Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it,"That assisted suicide might secure human dignity is a very popular idea. One of the most prominent organizations for assisted suicide in Europe is called “Dignitas”; American laws regulating assisted suicide are called “Death with Dignity Acts” (e.g., the “Washington Death with Dignity Act”); and numerous academic defenders of assisted suicide use the phrase “death with dignity” as a title or starting point for their argumentation. Apparently, the concept of dignity suits the intuitions very well that motivate people to fight for the legalization of physician-assisted death."

Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it,"A qualitative study using narrative interviews was conducted throughout the UK. Results shows that UK law should be changed to allow assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia was felt strongly by most people. Those who had seen others die were particularly convinced that this should be a right. Some had multiple reasons, including pain and anticipated pain, fear of indignity, loss of control and cognitive impairment. Those who did not want to be a burden also had other reasons for wanting euthanasia. Suicide was contemplated by a few, who would have preferred a change in the law to allow them to end their lives with medical help and in the company of family or friends. "
Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it,"Writing in 2005 about another bill on the topic introduced by Lord Joffe, the House of Lords Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill Committee summarised the debate in this way: The [Joffe] bill is founded on the principle of personal autonomy. Its supporters believe that terminally ill people should have the right, subject to prescribed safeguards, to have medical assistance to die in the same way that patients, whether or not terminally ill, already have the right to refuse life-prolonging treatment."
Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it,"The campaign group Dignity in Dying, of which Baroness Meacher is chair, has argued that current law contains no safeguards to protect dying people who want to control their death. It states that around 350 Britons have now travelled to Switzerland to end their life, at a cost of around £10,000 each. Dignity in Dying argues that many of these people travel before they are ready to die, because they are afraid of becoming too weak to make the journey. In theory, those that accompany them could face up to 14 years imprisonment. "
Assisted suicide reduces suffering,"The ethical arguments for physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia, advocates of euthanasia have maintained, do not apply to euthanasia only when it is voluntary; they can also be used to justify some kinds of nonvoluntary euthanasia of the incompetent."
Assisted suicide reduces suffering,"In early 2014, a New Mexico Second District Judge Nan Nash ruled that terminally ill patients have the right to aid in dying under the state constitution, i.e. making it legal for a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to a terminally ill patient."
Assisted suicide reduces suffering,Those who witness others die are 'particularly convinced' that the law should be changed to allow assisted death.
Assisted suicide reduces suffering,"Stevens also rejected the argument, raised by the petitioners, that permitting physician-assisted suicide would taint the perception of the doctor/patient relationship.

Assisted suicide reduces suffering,"It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life."
Assisted suicide reduces suffering,"Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much."
People should have the freedom to choose to end their life,"In early 2014, a New Mexico Second District Judge Nan Nash ruled that terminally ill patients have the right to aid in dying under the state constitution, i.e. making it legal for a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to a terminally ill patient."
People should have the freedom to choose to end their life,"In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life.

People should have the freedom to choose to end their life,"The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults."
The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide,"Dignity in Dying also outline how they go about their campaign: They encourage their supporters to campaign for a change to the current laws so that a terminally ill, mentally competent adult who feels their suffering has become unbearable can opt for an assisted death, subject to strict rules and safeguards.  They will lobby politicians and other decision makers, and look to educate legal and healthcare professionals and the public in general to support this drive towards obtaining a comprehensive national end-of-life strategy and working procedures."

The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide,"In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide."
Assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit,"For example, Swiss law allows assisted suicide while all forms of active euthanasia (like lethal injection) remain prohibited."
Assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit,"The patient must be an adult and in a 'futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated'.

Assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit,"Assisted suicide is when one individual helps another bring about their own death indirectly via providing either advice or the means to the end. This is in contrast to euthanasia, where another person takes a more active role in bringing about a person's death."
Assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit,"The report also stated that Kevorkian failed to refer at least 17 patients to a pain specialist after they complained of chronic pain, and sometimes failed to obtain a complete medical record for his patients, with at least three autopsies of suicides Kevorkian had assisted with showing the person who committed suicide to have no physical sign of disease."
Assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit,"As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia."

Assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better,"Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made."
Assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better,"Dignity in Dying support the legislation of assisted dying (as legal in Oregon under the Oregon Death with Dignity Act), whereby a doctor prescribes a life-ending dose of medication to a mentally competent, terminally ill adult at the patient's request, and which the patient administers. This is different to assisted suicide, whereby somebody provides assistance to die to a person who is not terminally ill, and euthanasia, which involves a third party administering the life-ending medication to a patient."
Assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better,"The key argument made by many of those opposed to a change in the law is that ill and disabled people may feel under pressure to end their lives, perhaps because of the cost of the medical treatment needed to keep them alive, or because they do not want to be a burden on friends and family."
Assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better,A survey published by the British Medical Journal in 2011 found that the majority of patients who are almost completely paralysed but fully conscious have said they are happy and do not want to die. The survey questioned 168 members of the French Association for Locked-in Syndrome.
Assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better,"In a study of terminally ill patients, for instance, Rosenfeld and his colleagues found that desire for death was associated with depression, and that desire decreased in patients who responded to antidepressants ( Psychosomatics , Vol. 51, No. 2, 2010)."
Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role,"For example, in the U.S. state of Oregon in 2007, it was reported that of the 30,000 deaths in the state that year, 10,000 people considered an assisted death, around 1,000 spoke to their doctor about it, 85 actually got a prescription and just 49 went on to have an assisted death."

Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills,"Although we acknowledged in the advantages section that homeschooled children do still develop socially, they naturally lose some interaction by spending more time at home. They may be out of touch with their peers, have fewer friends, and have less experience interacting with people from different backgrounds. Their view of the world could be very narrow and biased. In the worst cases, they could be brought up to be intolerant and misinformed, with little knowledge of general societal values. This could disadvantage them in the future."
Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills,"There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out."
Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills,"We often hear the idea that autistic people should be mainstreamed because exposure to neurotypical peers can improve their social skills.  In theory, because neurotypical children are more socially skilled than autistics, the autistic children need to be exposed to the neurotypicals in order to learn from them."
Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills,
Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills,"Researchers from Pennsylvania State University and Duke University tracked more than 700 children from across the US between kindergarten and age 25 and found a significant correlation between their social skills as kindergartners and their success as adults two decades later. The 20-year study showed that socially competent children who could cooperate with their peers without prompting, be helpful to others, understand their feelings, and resolve problems on their own, were far more likely to earn a college degree and have a full-time job by age 25 than those with limited social skills. Those with limited social skills also had a higher chance of getting arrested, binge drinking, and applying for public housing."
Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills,"Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints."
Parents are not qualified as teachers,Larry Kaseman of Home Education magazine argues that the Amendment's focus on rights rather than responsibilities will empower parents to treat their children like property and shelter unfit parents from punishment for neglect and abuse.
Parents are not qualified as teachers,"Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich (not to be confused with former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich) wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view, as their parents may, even unwittingly, block or diminish all points of view but their own in teaching."
Parents are not qualified as teachers,"The European Court took the position that the plaintiffs were the children, not their parents, and declared children are unable to foresee the consequences of their parents' decision for home education because of their young age... Schools represent society, and it is in the children's interest to become part of that society."
Parents are not qualified as teachers,"By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home."
Parents are not qualified as teachers,"In effect, you are adding two more jobs to your role as parent: you are also becoming a teacher and an administrator. As well as doing everything you do already, you have to plan and implement lessons, organise trips, coordinate activities with other parents, and make sure that you meet the local authority’s requirements. You will be spending a lot of time with your child – perhaps the whole day, every day – and you might not be able to do things that you normally do whilst they are at school. This can lead to stress and fatigue on your part."
Parents are not qualified as teachers,"In September 2006, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the German ban on homeschooling, stating 'parents may not refuse.. [compulsory schooling] on the basis of their convictions', and adding that the right to education 'calls for regulation by the State'."

Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized,"Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years."
Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized," I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off."
Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized,"Yes, as Calli Arcale and I both have said, homeschooling can be done effectively. However, without oversight, without someone looking in on these kids a few times for the 18 years they're under their parents thumb, the potential for abuse is there. And look, sure enough, abuse. What percentage of kids are abused this way? Who knows? What level would be acceptable? I would suggest zero-tolerance. If even 1% of households are homeschooling with the goal of restricting their children's options, and leaving them functionally illiterate so they're easier to be controlled by their husbands, or parents, than we might be looking at as many as 15-20,000 kids being denied an education. Kids that could be getting that education around the corner in their public school."
Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality,"In September 2006, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the German ban on homeschooling, stating 'parents may not refuse.. [compulsory schooling] on the basis of their convictions', and adding that the right to education 'calls for regulation by the State'."
Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality,"The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling."
Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality,"David Engelsma, Professor Emeritus of the Protestant Reformed Seminary writes that 'Even though home-schooling of their children might be possible for a few, specially gifted parents whose circumstances provide the time that is needed, home-schooling is still not an option'."
Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality,Teachers are public schools are required to carry education degrees and they may have more experience working with and teaching children. Teaching a child is different from parenting a child and many parents struggle to do both.
Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality,"Anderson and his daughter Mary spoke up in support of home schooling in March 2008, after a state appellate court in California issued a ruling that children who are the product of home schooling need to be credentialed."

Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God,"Above all, Paul VI states that the human person is more than simply flesh, and that any true call to a life devoted to God that includes celibacy will also be aided by God's own grace to sustain it: The true, profound reason for dedicated celibacy is, as We have said, the choice of a closer and more complete relationship with the mystery of Christ and the Church for the good of all mankind: in this choice there is no doubt that those highest human values are able to find their fullest expression"
Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God,"By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life."
Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God,"Garry Wills, in his book Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit, argued that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world. In his discussion concerning the origins of the said policy, Wills mentioned that the Church drew its inspiration from the ascetics, monks who devote themselves to meditation and total abstention from earthly wealth and pleasures in order to sustain their corporal and spiritual purity, after seeing that its initial efforts in propagating the faith were fruitless. The rationale behind such strict policy is that it significantly helps the priests perform well in their religious services while at the same time following the manner in which Jesus Christ lived his life"
Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God,Supporters of clerical celibacy answer that God only calls men to the priesthood if they are capable. Those who are not called to the priesthood should seek other paths in life since they will be able to serve God better there.

Celibacy is a strong religious belief,"In 1074, mandatory celibacy of the clergy became canon law as part of Pope Gregory VII's effort to eliminate several forms of medieval church corruption."
Celibacy is a strong religious belief,Supporters of celibacy claim that Roman Catholic priests suffering sexual temptations are not likely to turn immediately to a teenage boy simply because Church discipline does not permit clergy to marry.
Celibacy is a strong religious belief,"Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy."

Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy,"Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment."
Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy,"In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity."
Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy,"Practically speaking, the reasons for celibacy are given by the Apostle Paul in I Corinthians 7:7-8; 32-35: But I would have you to be without solicitude. He that is without a wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please God. But he that is with a wife, is solicitous for the things of the world, how he may please his wife: and he is divided. And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit. But she that is married thinketh on the things of this world how she may please her husband. And this I speak for your profit, not to cast a snare upon you, but for that which is decent and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord without impediment"
Priests choose to be celibates,"Paul, says Laurent Cleenewerck, a priest of the Orthodox Church in America and professor of theology at Euclid University, clearly favored celibacy, which he understood as a gift. Cleenewerck supports this statement by quoting , Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. This I say by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am."
Priests choose to be celibates,"Catholic nuns are more successful at fulfilling their vows of celibacy and more willing to commit to their promises of sexual abstinence than male clergy, suggesting women can more easily adapt to such high non-permissive standards."
Priests choose to be celibates,"Moreover, priestly celibacy is held in great honor in the Eastern Churches and many priests have freely chosen it for the sake of the Kingdom of God."
Priests choose to be celibates,"Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum."
Priests choose to be celibates,"Philippe Delhaye wrote: During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons... The apostolic constitutions (c. 400) excommunicated a priest or bishop who left his wife 'under pretense of piety' (Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio 1:51)."

Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained,Another important matter which the legate had been ordered to carry out was the enforcement of the law of clerical celibacy.
Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained,"Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence."
Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts,"During the early 20th century, prominent feminist and birth control advocate Margaret Sanger argued that abstinence from sexual activity led to greater endurance and strength, and was a sign of the best of the species"

Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts,"Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training."
Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts,"The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church.

Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts,"According to Dr Rachel Needle, psychologist and co-director of Modern Sex Therapy Institutes, having sex can be positive for people’s physical and mental health. It helps you sleep better, decreasing pain, lowering stress, lessening anxiety and depression, and more. Symptoms arise at different times based on people’s needs and can show up anywhere from a few weeks to a few months."
Celibacy is outdated,"The Byzantine theological, liturgical, and canonical tradition unanimously stresses the absolute uniqueness of Christian marriage, and bases this emphasis upon the teaching of Ephesians 5. As a sacrament, or mysterion, marriage reflects the union between Christ and the Church, between Yahweh and Israel, and as such can be only one-an eternal bond, which death itself does not destroy. In its sacramental nature, marriage transfigures and transcends both fleshly union and contractual legal association: human love is being projected into the eternal Kingdom of God"
Celibacy is outdated,"Moreover, the knights of the order were virtually secularized: Pope Paul III commuted their vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity (1540)."
Celibacy is outdated,"The theologian Josse Clichtove working at the University of Paris interpreted this as an attack on chastity, but Erasmus had found favour with Protestant reformers who acknowledged the argument as a useful tool to undermine compulsory clerical celibacy and monasticism ."
Celibacy is outdated,"George T. Dennis SJ of Catholic University of America says: 'There is simply no clear evidence of a general tradition or practice, much less of an obligation, of priestly celibacy-continence before the beginning of the fourth century.' Peter Fink SJ agrees, saying that underlying premises used in the book, Apostolic Origins of Priestly Celibacy, 'would not stand up so comfortably to historical scrutiny'. Dennis says this book provides no evidence that celibacy had apostolic origins."

Celibacy is outdated,"From its beginnings, the idea of clerical celibacy has been contested in canon courts, in theology, and in religious practices."
Celibacy is outdated,"Perhaps the most striking example is that in most Eastern Catholic Churches, ordination of married men to the priesthood is routine (although no priest may marry after ordination, and only celibate priests may become bishops)."
Celibacy is outdated,"Because priestly celibacy is a discipline, and not an infallible dogma of the Church, the discipline of celibacy within the Latin Rite may be lifted in the future, although that is currently unlikely."
Celibacy is outdated,"In addition, John Paul II chose not to end the discipline of mandatory priestly celibacy, although in a small number of unusual circumstances, he did allow certain married clergymen of other Christian traditions who later became Catholic to be ordained as Catholic priests."

Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural,"the noted German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche spoke of the positive physiological effects of abstinence: 'The reabsorption of semen by the blood .. perhaps prompts the stimulus of power, the unrest of all forces towards the overcoming of resistances .. The feeling of power has so far mounted highest in abstinent priests and hermits' (quoted by Walter Kaufman in his classic, Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist, p. 222"
Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural,"Protestant apologists further argue that clerical celibacy violates the Biblical teaching in the First Epistle to Timothy:. The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving."
Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural,"Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced."
Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural,"Men are driven by testosterone to want sex, says John Wass, Professor of Endocrinology at Oxford University. Women are driven to a lesser degree by a mixture of testosterone and oestrogen, he explains. ’I'd regard celibacy as a totally abnormal state.’ Around 80-90% of men masturbate and it's likely that priests do too, he says. There is data to suggest that men who ejaculate more are less prone to prostate cancer, he says. You could argue that it's not so healthy to be celibate."
Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural,Celibacy is an unnatural act in nature. All living organisms are meant to reproduce. The sexual act is critical for the survival of the species.

Celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests,"As the date of the second test approaches, Bobby and Connie are dismayed to learn that if he truly is the lama, he will have to take a vow of celibacy."
Celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests,"Celibacy restricts the pool of eligible candidates for priesthood and diminishes its quality. The requirement of celibacy eliminates many men who desire to have a wife and family and sexual intimacy as much as a religious vocation. Every priest who has ever suggested a priestly vocation to young men has heard the response, 'I would become a priest, but I don't want to give up falling in love or having sex or having children.' Makes sense. Worldwide, the number of Catholic priests has 'flatlined' at about 400,000 for the last 50 years. Numbers are way down in Europe and in the Americas, where priests are headed for extinction."
Marriage benefits children,"Moreover, a 2010 CDC study on child well-being and family structure shows that children from homes with married parents did better in every category."
Marriage benefits children," Research by the Institute for American Values shows that children raised in intact married families are more likely to attend college, are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused, less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviors, have a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager, and are less likely to be raised in poverty."
Marriage benefits children,"Research suggests that those who are married (when compared with non-married or cohabitating couples) live longer, have lower rates of physical and mental illness, are better off financially, experience higher sexual and relationship satisfaction, and have better parenting outcomes."
Marriage benefits children,"t one end of a spectrum are parents who married before the child arrived, where those children have a relatively high likelihood of receiving extensive co-parenting. "
Marriage benefits children,"One  of  the  factors  that  influence  adolescent  psychological  well-being  is  the role  of  family and  parents.  In  general,  parental  marriage  contributes  to  the  well-being  of  children  (Ribar, 2015) because  of  the financial  support between  husband and  wife, social  interaction between family members, and  stability  of  the relationship  between  parents who  are  bound  in marriage commitments.  Shek  et  al.  (2014)  found  that  parental  marital  conditions,  family  functioning, relationships  between  children  and  parents,  and  communication  patterns  affect  the  level  of psychological well-being  of  adolescents. "
Marriage benefits children,"In married families, about one- third of adolescents are sexually active. For teenagers in stepfamilies, cohabiting households, divorced families, and those with single unwed parents, the percentage rises above one-half (The Positive Effects of Marriage: A Book of Charts, Patrick Fagan)."
Marriage benefits children,"Children raised in intact married families tend to earn higher grades than those in non-intact families.1) For example, kindergarten children from married families have higher reading scores than those from cohabiting families.2) Parents in always-intact married families are also more likely to help their children do their homework than are parents in stepfamilies or single-parent families,3) and fathers in always-intact married families are more involved in their children’s homework than are stepfathers.4) Compared with children in stable married families, students experiencing parental divorce have lower academic expectations and test scores.5)"
Marriage benefits children,"Plenty of research indicates that healthy marriage positively impacts children and society. And despite growing up with examples of unhealthy marriages, divorce or other adverse childhood experiences, it’s possible to heal from the past and have healthy relationships and even healthy marriages."
Marriage benefits children,"Ellen Greaves, research economist at the IFS, and one of the authors of the report, said: It is true that children born to married couples are on average more cognitively and emotionally successful than children born to cohabiting couples. But careful analysis shows that this largely reflects the differences between the types of people who decide to get married and those who don't."

Marriage benefits children,"Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)."
"Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons","Throughout the ages, governments of all types have recognized marriage as essential in preserving social stability and perpetuating life. Regardless of whether marriages were performed as a religious rite or a civil ceremony, in almost every culture marriage has been protected and endorsed by governments primarily to preserve and foster the institution most central to rearing children and teaching them the moral values that undergird civilization."
"Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons",Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. Marriage is the beginning—the beginning of the family—and is a life-long commitment. It also provides an opportunity to grow in selflessness as you serve your wife and children. Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. This union mirrors the one between God and His Church.
"Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons","When a man and woman get married, the two become one. Marriage is a bond like no other. It gives us a life partner, a teammate, as we move through the challenges of life together."
"Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons","Marriage is designed for purity. We face temptation nearly every minute and from all directions. The bond of marriage gives us the support to defeat temptation by engaging in deep, satisfying love—a love that gives to, and receives from, our mate physically, emotionally, and spiritually."
"Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons","When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family"
"Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons","Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow."
Marriage makes people happy,Evidence published by John Helliwell (and Shawn Grover) in the Journal of Happiness Studies finds that marriage makes people happier and that they continue to be more satisfied years into the marriage.
Marriage makes people happy,"Married people overall do better on virtually every indicator of health and well-being, says Robin Simon, a sociology professor and researcher at Wake Forest University. Even when they get sick, married people are more likely to recover."
Marriage makes people happy,"Married couples are happier than everyone else, whether they’re single, divorced, widowed or separated, according to a new study published by The Office for National Statistics in the UK."
Marriage makes people happy,"The study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, found that in most parts of the world, being married makes people happier, no matter how happy they were before tying the knot. And that happiness lasts for a long time, through life's trials and tribulations. Why? Researchers believe that having a spouse can make it easier to deal when times get rough."
Marriage makes people happy,"But while cohabitation is on the rise, data from Pew and other sources continue to show that married Americans enjoy greater overall happiness, as well as greater satisfaction with their relationships. The marriage happiness premium extends to nearly every aspect of a couple's relationship, with one notable exception: their sex lives."
Marriage makes people happy,"In recent years, the General Social Survey, a long-running nationally representative survey of American adults, began explicitly asking respondents about their current relationship status: are you married, cohabiting, or neither? The responses show a sort of relationship-happiness gradient, with married people reporting the most overall happiness, cohabitating partners reporting somewhat less happiness, and singletons were the least satisfied of all."
Marriage makes people happy,"Even middle-aged people, who generally tend to be unhappier than people in other stages of life, according to Science Daily, were able to enjoy an elevated level of happiness if they were married. Marriage may help ease the causes of a mid-life dip in life satisfaction and the benefits of marriage are unlikely to be short-lived, Helliwell explained."
Marriage makes people happy,"It’s not marriage that makes you happy, it’s happy marriage that makes you happy, Gilbert said. Married people are happier than unmarried ones, perhaps because the single best predictor of human happiness is the quality of social relationships. Marriage seems to buy you a decade or more of happiness, Gilbert said. "
Marriage makes people happy,"Other recent research, however, has challenged this pessimistic view. Data from a large British panel survey show that marriage increased long-run happiness, suggesting that selection isn’t the whole story. Perhaps marriage doesn’t make Germans happy, but it does seem to make the English happy. Likewise, a paper using panel data from Taiwan has found somewhat more durable positive effects of marriage (though this there was a lot of variety in happiness trajectories, and Christians might get more happiness from marriage than other people)."
Marriage makes people happy,"The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married.  "
Marriage makes people happy,The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married.
Marriage makes the couple closer,Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult. About eight-in-ten married adults (78%) say they feel closer to their spouse than to any other adult in their life; a narrower majority of cohabiters (55%) say the same about their partner.
Marriage makes the couple closer,"Those who are married are more likely than those who are cohabiting to say they have a great deal of trust in their spouse or partner to be faithful to them, act in their best interest, always tell them the truth and handle money responsibly."

Marriage makes the couple closer,The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting.
Marriage makes the couple closer,Love and marriage advice: Couples need to constantly work on their relationship to have a healthy and happy marriage.
Marriage makes the couple closer,Each decision you as a couple can successfully make together brings you closer to each other.
Marriage provides important financial benefits,"One of the most significant advantages of marriage is eligibility for Social Security spousal and survival benefits. First, as a married couple, you're each eligible to collect your own Social Security benefit or up to 50 percent of your spouse's benefit, whichever is greater. This can be a financial plus if one of you is a higher earner. "
Marriage provides important financial benefits,"Getting married makes financial sense, especially for people who have widely disparate incomes. For example: The annual income limitations for IRA contributions by married couples are based on joint income, allowing for far higher savings. A couple's combined income may well place them in a lower tax bracket than the higher-income spouse would pay as an individual. If each spouse has a different employer, each can choose the better of two health insurance plans. Car insurance and home insurance coverage are cheaper for two than for one. In the long run, the lower-paid spouse may be eligible for a larger Social Security benefit than the person's solo income would allow."
Marriage provides important financial benefits,"Whatever the reason, tying the knot is likely to lower those monthly rates. In fact, the average married couple in the US pays 11% less per person than their single counterparts. That’s a pretty big savings, especially over the long term."
Marriage provides important financial benefits,"One of the most obvious financial advantages of marriage is income splitting. The goal of income splitting is to shift income from a higher income partner to a lower income partner. For couples with different income levels and different marginal tax rates, income splitting can create a sizable tax advantage."
Marriage provides important financial benefits,"One advantage is that spouses can transfer money and assets between them other tax-free, which can reduce your overall tax bill."
Marriage provides important financial benefits,"There are yet more savings to be had when it comes to inheritance tax. When one of you dies, any money or assets passed on are free from inheritance tax if you’re married."
Marriage provides important financial benefits,"While the standard deduction is higher for a couple, combining your income could impact some of your deductions if you itemize."
Marriage provides important financial benefits,"When an unmarried person includes a partner on their health insurance plan, that benefit is taxable. For married couples, premiums to cover both are tax deductible."
Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women,"According to CNN, dowry-related woman abuse in the country is often caused by dissatisfaction over the amount of dowry received, as it has become more of a condition of marriage, rather than a gift. Women are known to commit suicide, driven by the pressure of not being able to keep up with dowry payments, or they face violence within their marriage, or are murdered for the same reason. "
Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women,"Millions of girls around the world experience female genital mutilation (FGM) as a prerequisite to marriage or as a means to control a woman’s sexuality before marriage. This is an infringement on a woman’s right to her bodily autonomy, and as it is often performed on school-aged girls, also stops them from being able to access education and deprives them of their childhood, as well as causing both short- and long-term health consequences.  "
Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women,"Women must be submissive to male family members in all aspects of her life. Rigid gender roles often result in the expectation that women be submissive to male family members. When married, women are expected to obey their husbands, act according to their wishes and not strive for equal decision making. If they transgress these norms they may face physical violence used by husbands as punishment or discipline."
Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women,"Roughly one in three girls in Zimbabwe is married by her eighteenth birthday. Discriminatory social norms that link a girl’s perceived “purity” to her family’s honor are among the factors that push girls into marriage. According to Human Rights Watch, young women and girls who become pregnant, stay out late, are seen in the company of suspected boyfriends, or are otherwise thought to be sexually active can be forced into marriage in order to preserve their familial honor."

Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women,"As soon as my relationships turned serious and steady, men started to expect too much and offer too little. It was self-understood that I, as a woman, would take care of the home, wait for him gladly while he would be god knows where doing god knows what, and deal with his jealousy on the top of that."

Marriages are unstable,"More recent evidence from the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study tipped the balance for many in favor of the pro-marriage arguments. Designed by two prominent academics, Sara McLanahan and Irv Garfinkel, the study is a longitudinal survey of 5,000 low-income married and nonmarried parents conducted in 75 hospitals in twenty cities at the time of their child’s birth. Among mothers who were not married when their child was born, 83 percent reported that they were romantically involved with the father, and half of the parents were living together. Nearly all of the romantically involved couples expressed interest in developing long-term stable relationships, and there was universal interest in marriage, with most indicating that there was at least a fifty-fifty chance that they would marry in the future. Looking at employment history and other factors, researchers estimated that about a third of the couples had high potential to marry; another third had some problems, like lack of a job, that could be remedied; while the final third were not good candidates due to a history of violence, incarceration, and the like (McLanahan, Garfinkel, and Mincy, 2001)."
Marriages are unstable," Alison, for instance, found that her husband would go out with his friends at the weekend while she stayed at home, preparing lessons and doing the housework. Then there are factors that have the capacity to bring everything to a head. Money is one. “He’d say, ‘Well, you chose to have a low-paid job,’” Alison says. By then they’d had a (planned and wanted) baby, and children are another acknowledged marriage stressor. They bring high strain (in terms of finances, fatigue and housework) and often highlight different standards of care. “It wasn’t an easy time,” Alison says. “It reinforced just how different we were. Before, when we argued, I just thought, ‘Well, we’ll make up a few hours later.’ But when you’ve got a child, you don’t want to be falling out all the time."
Marriages are unstable,"When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”"
Marriages are unstable,"Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers looked in detail at the changes and driving forces in marriage and divorce rates in the US.14 They suggest that the changes we see in divorce rates may be partly reflective of the changes in expectations within marriages as women entered the workforce. Women who married before the large rise in female employment may have found themselves in marriages where expectations were no longer suited. Many people in the postwar years married someone who was probably a good match for the postwar culture, but ended up being the wrong partner after the times had changed. This may have been a driver behind the steep rise in divorces throughout the 1970s and 1980s."
Marriages are unstable,You might have heard the popularised claim that “half of marriages end in divorce”. We can see here where that claim might come from – it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years.
Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations,The Equality Act says you must not be discriminated against in employment because you are married or in a civil partnership.
Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations,"The fact that men are legendarily wary of marriage is stranger than it first appears. Both men and women benefit from marriage, but men seem to benefit more overall. In addition to being happier and healthier than bachelors, married men earn more money and live longer."
Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations,"Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband."
Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations,"It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience."
Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations,"Mariticide was one form of crime which women could not justify by claiming marital coercion – obviously if a woman kills her husband, she cannot give marital coercion as reasoning. However, within the crime of mariticide, gender inequality is once more revealed. Whilst when a man killed his wife (uxoricide), the crime was simply murder, a woman’s killing of her husband came under the offence of petty treason until the abolition of the offence of petty treason in 1838. An attack on a husband was an attack on a lord and master and thus akin to a challenge to the authority of the crown. For crimes of treason, individuals were usually hung, drawn, and quartered, but as this was deemed to be inappropriate for women they were instead burnt at the stake. Whilst to many this may seem like a more grotesque punishment, there were some small concessions for women: for example, if she was pregnant the execution was postponed, and if she was fortunate, she might be strangled before being burnt at the stake – though that hardly seems like much of a privilege. "
Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations,"Gender relations between men and women were also evident in the different treatment of both male and female adultery. The inequality is at its clearest in the 1650 Adultery Act passed under Oliver Cromwell, which stated that if a woman committed adultery she would be sentenced to death, whereas if a man committed adultery, he would be sentenced to three months imprisonment unless he committed adultery with a married woman, in which case he would be sentenced to death also. This act did lapse after the Reformation; however, it does evidence the inequality in sentencing."
Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship,"It's such a dominant approach to love and partnership and so ingrained into the very fabric of many societies today, monogamy may seem like simply the way relationships work. "
Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship,"In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time."
Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship,"From a health perspective, one of the big advantages of monogamy is the reduced risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like HIV, gonorrhea and herpes. There are ways to get STDS other than sex, such as intravenous drug use in the case of HIV. In most cases the chances of contracting one are extremely low, unless you or your partner previously had an STD. Non-monogamous people are at a higher risk for contracting STDs due to involvememtn with multiple partners and those who may or may not know or wish to share their history of STDs."
Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship,"Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time."
Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship, Knowing that a partner will always prioritize time and personal investment to a single person leaves that person with greater confidence that the emotional dynamics and support system will retain it’s stability. More so than it would with someone who divides time and personal investment between multiple partners who may have changing needs and wants.

He can talk Christianity and all that. That is all my father is. That’s all he’s ever been, is a con man… If he found redemption, that doesn’t matter, that’s between him and God. His forgiveness is to come from the Lord and his redemption is to come from the Lord, not the government. The Bible also says, ‘An eye for an eye.’"
The death penalty helps the victim/their family,"Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt."

The death penalty prevents crimes,"Charles Stimson, JD, Acting Chief of Staff and Senior Legal Fellow of the Heritage Foundation, in a Dec. 20, 2019 article, The Death Penalty Is Appropriate, available at heritage.org, stated: That said, the death penalty serves three legitimate penological objectives: general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. The first, general deterrence, is the message that gets sent to people who are thinking about committing heinous crimes that they shouldn’t do it or else they might end up being sentenced to death. The second, specific deterrence, is specific to the defendant. It simply means that the person who is subjected to the death penalty won’t be alive to kill other people. The third penological goal, retribution, is an expression of society’s right to make a moral judgment by imposing a punishment on a wrongdoer befitting the crime he has committed. Twenty-nine states, and the people’s representatives in Congress have spoken loudly; the death penalty should be available for the worst of the worst."
The death penalty prevents crimes,"Armstrong Williams, Owner and Manager of Howard Stirk Holdings I & II Broadcast Television Stations, in a May, 25, 2021 article, “The Death Penalty Remains the Strongest Deterrent to Violent Crime,” available at thehill.com, stated: There must be some form to hold murderers accountable and, historically, the death penalty has been the most effective way of doing so. It could very well be that a firing squad is the most humane way, especially compared to lethal injection, where there have been cases of prisoners experiencing excruciating pain for sometimes over an hour. These examples are certainly worthy of our consideration and discussion. But one thing is clear: We still need the death penalty, if for no other reason, as a deterrent for other potential criminals."
The death penalty prevents crimes,"David Muhlhausen, PhD, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, stated the following in his Oct. 4, 2014 article “Capital Punishment Works: It Deters Crime,” available at dailysignal.com: Some crimes are so heinous and inherently wrong that they demand strict penalties – up to and including life sentences or even death. Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect. Indeed, other recent investigations, using a variety of samples and statistical methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates… In short, capital punishment does, in fact, save lives."
The death penalty prevents crimes,"Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders."

The death penalty harms the disenfranchised,"In a recent op-ed in the Albuquerque Journal, the president of the New Mexico Criminal Defense Lawyers Association discussed the high costs of the federal death penalty. In particular, Barbara Mandel detailed the expenses involved in the recent federal trial of John McCluskey. He was sentenced to life without parole, an outcome that Mandel wrote, occurred years and at least a million dollars later than it should have. According to the op-ed, McCluskey had been willing to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence less than death early on, and, in February 2013, a senior judge offered to mediate the case. Although then-U.S. Attorney Kenneth Gonzalez rejected the offer, he did acknowledge that federal capital prosecutions inflict logistical and financial burdens on the entire federal system."
The death penalty harms the disenfranchised,"A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare."

The death penalty irreversible,"Emmaline Soken-Huberty, freelance author, in an undated article, 5 Reasons Why The Death Penalty is Wrong, accessed on Sep. 2, 2021 and available at humanrightscareers.com, stated: The fact that it doesn’t prevent crime may be the most significant reason why the death penalty is wrong. Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it."
The death penalty irreversible,"Craig Trocino, JD, Director of the Innocence Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: The death penalty is not a deterrent despite the claims of its proponents. In 2012 the National Research Council concluded that the studies claiming it is a deterrence were fundamentally flawed. Additionally, a 2009 study of criminologists concluded that 88 percent of criminologists did not believe in the death penalties deterrence while only 5 percent did. Perhaps the most consistent and interesting data that the death penalty is not a deterrence is to look at the murder rates of states that do not have the death penalty in comparison to those that do. In states that have recently abolished the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates. In fact, since 1990 states without the death penalty have consistently had lower murder rates than states that have it."
The death penalty irreversible,"Nick Petersen, PhD, Assistant Professor of Sociology and Law at the University of Miami, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: Social science research does not support the contention that the death penalty deters crime. In 1978, the National Research Council, one of the most prestigious scientific institutions in the nation and world, noted that “available studies provide no useful evidence on the deterrent effect of capital punishment.” A 2012 report by the National Research Council reached a similar conclusion. Citing a number of problems with deterrence research, the council reported that “claims that research demonstrates that capital punishment decreases or increases the homicide rate by a specified amount or has no effect on the homicide rate should not influence policy judgments about capital punishment."
The death penalty irreversible,"John J. Donohue III, JD, PhD, Professor of Law at Stanford University, stated the following in his Aug. 8, 2015 article There’s No Evidence That Death Penalty Is a Deterrent against Crime, available at theconversation.com: There is not the slightest credible statistical evidence that capital punishment reduces the rate of homicide. Whether one compares the similar movements of homicide in Canada and the US when only the latter restored the death penalty, or in American states that have abolished it versus those that retain it, or in Hong Kong and Singapore (the first abolishing the death penalty in the mid-1990s and the second greatly increasing its usage at the same), there is no detectable effect of capital punishment on crime. The best econometric studies reach the same conclusion… Last year roughly 14,000 murders were committed but only 35 executions took place. Since murderers typically expose themselves to far greater immediate risks, the likelihood is incredibly remote that some small chance of execution many years after committing a crime will influence the behaviour of a sociopathic deviant who would otherwise be willing to kill if his only penalty were life imprisonment. Any criminal who actually thought he would be caught would find the prospect of life without parole to be a monumental penalty. Any criminal who didn’t think he would be caught would be untroubled by any sanction."
The death penalty irreversible,"H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won’t commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force."

Atheism lacks morality,"Some were vehemently ethically opposed, such as Maximilien Robespierre, who argued that atheism was a dangerous product of aristocratic decadence, and believed that a moral society should at least acknowledge the provenance of a Supreme Being."
Atheism lacks morality,"In the 18th century, Denis Diderot argued that atheism was less scientific than metaphysics."
Atheism lacks morality,"In his Dictionnaire historique et critique he stated that while atheists were exceedingly blind and ignorant of the nature of things there were many atheists who are no way distinguished for their vices, and that if atheists exist, who, morally speaking, are well-disposed, it follows that Atheism is not a necessary cause of immorality, but simply an incidental one in regard to those who would have been immoral from disposition or temperament, whether Atheists or not."
Atheism lacks morality,"Douglas Wilson, an evangelical theologian, argues that while atheists can behave morally, belief is necessary for an individual to give a rational and coherent account of why they are obligated to lead a morally responsible life."

People should choose for themselves whether Atheism should be adopted,"The European Court of Human Rights has found that a person cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behaviour associated with a particular religion. This means, for example, that public authorities should take care when using procedures that involve the swearing of oaths. A requirement to swear on a religious text, such as the Bible, would breach human rights law. An alternative form of affirmation should be available that isn’t connected with religion."
People should choose for themselves whether Atheism should be adopted,"Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."

Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it,"Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves-to be able to discern, for example, that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one's religion instructs it-and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations."
Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it,"La Mettrie defended a purely pleasure-based view of the proper end of human life, and advocated atheism as the only means of liberating human beings from the various forms of oppression which stand in the way of human progress."
Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it,"Rubin interprets the painting as expressing the artist's atheism, his willingness to risk anarchy for freedom, his fear of disease and illness, and, most forcefully, 'his deep-seated fear and loathing of the female body, which existed side by side with his craving for and ecstatic idealization of it.'."
Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it,"Being an atheists often comes with contradictory ideologies that the society thrusts upon people but on the inside, atheists are free of conflicting ideas. They do not need to debate almost every time some stranger comments or offends any religion for they not believe in religion. They do not ever get into heated debates about which religion is better than the other."
Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it,They believe in scientific explanations and do not dwell on mythologies that are most of the time impossible to believe in unless you are a blind follower. Their reasons and concepts are clear and they are happy about whatever they believe to be true. Satisfaction at heart is the most important thing people seek and atheism brings it in the most literary and non-mythical way.
Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it,Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you don’t pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with.
Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it,"I have heard from atheists that they find it really blissful for not having to worry about your privacy being invaded by an invisible someone who keeps an eye on whatever you are doing and thinking and totally judging you for it. Keeping morals intact, you are totally free to do whatever you want to do without having to worry about two little fellows writing your books of good deeds and sins. Added advantage indeed."
Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it,"Religion is more about accepting morals without questioning their validity or updating knowledge according to new changes and information. Atheism is all about logical explanations and theists find it easier for them to adapt to new information, knowledge or facts that comes with research through time. Theists, on the other hand, reject updated information when it comes to religion shunning logic completely."
Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists,"Another document claimed at around the same time that one Marlowe is able to show more sound reasons for Atheism than any divine in England is able to give to prove divinity, and that .. he hath read the Atheist lecture to Sir Walter Raleigh and others."
Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists,"A few years ago, in a conversation with fellow atheist Peter Boghossian, Richard Dawkins admitted that no evidence would convince him of God’s existence as he could always explain it away."
Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists,"A metaphysically courageous atheist might try a more direct line of attack. He might acknowledge that God is not understood by theists to be a part of the physical universe and therefore is not the kind of thing that could be observed. Nevertheless, he might maintain that it is not rational to believe in what is not observable. Therefore, if by “God” we mean something inherently unobservable, then belief in him is inherently irrational. It is not simply that the “God hypothesis” fails an empirical test; it fails even to be a meaningful hypothesis. Such an argument, if successful, would have the benefit (from the atheist’s point of view) of ruling out not only belief in God but also belief in a host of other things that many atheists find suspect, from minds to objective moral values."
Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists,Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence.
Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists,"Theodore Drange (2006)  has developed an argument that if God were the sort of being that wanted humans to come to believe that he exists, then he could bring it about that far more of them would believe than currently do.  God would be able, he would want humans to believe, there is nothing that he would want more, and God would not be irrational.  So God would bring it about that people would believe.  In general, he could have brought it about that the evidence that people have is far more convincing than what they have.  He could have miraculously appeared to everyone in a fashion that was far more compelling than the miracles stories that we have.  It is not the case that all, nearly all, or even a majority of people believe, so there must not be a God of that sort."
Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists,"J.L. Schellenberg (1993) has developed an argument based upon a number of considerations that lead us to think that if there were a loving God, then we would expect to find some manifestations of him in the world.  If God is all powerful, then there would be nothing restraining him from making his presence known.  And if he is omniscient, then surely he would know how to reveal himself.  Perhaps, most importantly, if God is good and if God possesses an unsurpassable love for us, then God would consider each human’s requests as important and seek to respond quickly.  He would wish to spare those that he loves needless trauma.  He would not want to give those that he loves false or misleading thoughts about his relationship to them.  He would want as much personal interaction with them as possible, but of course, these conditions are not satisfied.  So it is strongly indicated that there is no such God."
Religions are immoral and people should not follow them,"As Michael J. Buckley writes, If atheism was unacceptable, superstition and fanaticism were even more so."
Religions are immoral and people should not follow them,"If you are following a list of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Religion confuses obedience with morality. Morality is actually thinking about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people. If you’re not doing that, and instead following the rules in a old book, then you are being obedient. Obedience is amoral. At best! An argument can be made that obedience is utterly irresponsible because by ceding your autonomy to the rules you follow you demonstrate that you don’t care how your actions affect others."
Religions are immoral and people should not follow them,Religion is immoral because it is a lie. There are no gods. No heaven . No hell. It is immoral to lie to billions of people to manipulate them and take their money.
Religions are immoral and people should not follow them,"Of all the modern religions, Christianity is possibly the most immoral. It sets unrealistic expectations, talks about punishment, has an OT history of wiping out whole nations of people, is responsible for the crusades and the indecent forced conversion of millions around the world, perpetrated violence against Muslims and other non-Christian nations, talks about a god who will send you into a fiery hell, because you, his supposed creation, does not cow-tow to his need for devotion, and sees priests, pastors and ministers take sexual advantage of their followers, whether children, female or married. A close second would have to be the Muslim religion with similar beliefs and atrocious actions (female genital mutilations anyone?) and a complete intolerance of apostates. And that’s only scratching the surface."
Religions are immoral and people should not follow them,"Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that that’s a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor."
Religions are immoral and people should not follow them,"Religious people often claim that religion provides them with a sense of hope or comfort. A belief in the power of prayer, for example, might provide someone with a greater sense of control over the events in their lives. They are never powerless, because they can always appeal to God to intervene on their behalf. Similarly, a belief in the afterlife might make the grief and despair of losing a loved one more manageable, as the bereaved person can take comfort knowing that they will be reunited with their loved one in heaven. Likewise,  we also can’t ignore the fact that religion also causes stress, often by threatening eternal damnation and torture if you don’t unquestioningly accept its claims. This would make religion an evolutionary disadvantage, as people of faith would be more likely to suffer from stress-related conditions and have a lower likelihood of passing on their genes."
Science can adequately explain the Universe,"While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. ."
Science can adequately explain the Universe,A 2010 survey found that those identifying themselves as atheists or agnostics are on average more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths.
Science can adequately explain the Universe,"An atheist before Darwin could have said, following Hume: I have no explanation for complex biological design. All I know is that God isn't a good explanation, so we must wait and hope that somebody comes up with a better one. I can't help feeling that such a position, though logically sound, would have left one feeling pretty unsatisfied, and that although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. The Blind Watchmaker (1986)"
Science can adequately explain the Universe,"Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is one who is hostile to faith. Lennox quotes him more extensively on p18 of Gunning for God. 'The world needs to wake up from the long nightmare of religion. Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.'"
Science can adequately explain the Universe,"According to a standard heroic secular account, at the start of the modern age and in just a few short decades, science was able to defeat religion through rigour and brilliance – and thereby forever liberated humankind from ignorance and superstition. For centuries, this account explains, religion had essentially been doing some very bad science. It had purported to tell us how old the earth was (4,000 years old), how many suns there were in the universe (one), how evolution had begun (by divine decree) and why rainbows existed (to remind us of God’s promise to Noah). But these lamentable attempts were finally put to an end when science was able to investigate reality with reason, asserted itself against obscurantist priests – and drove religion into the cobwebbed attic it presently resides in. Science didn’t so much replace religion (there was no need) as expunge the scourge altogether from human consciousness. As a result, we can now dwell without fear or meekness and enjoy the fruits of science and its constant, ever more astonishing technological innovations."

Libertarianism harms economic growth,"Both, say Steven Telesopen in new window and Brink Lindseyopen in new window, who visited Stanford Graduate School of Business recently as part of its Corporations and Society Initiative. Teles, a left-leaning professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, and Lindsey, a libertarian-leaning researcher at the Washington, D.C., think tank Niskanen Center, coauthored The Captured Economy: How the Powerful Enrich Themselves, Slow Down Growth, and Increase Inequality. The authors critique laws and regulations that they believe result from poor policymaking practices and ultimately suppress economic growth and hurt the public. While the two authors ask conservatives to recognize that income inequality threatens growth, they also show liberals that government regulation, if misguided or badly constructed, can do more harm than good by increasing inequality."
Libertarianism harms economic growth,"The validity of right-libertarian notions of liberty and economic freedom have been questioned by critics such as Robert Lee Hale, who posits that laissez-faire capitalism is a system of aggressive coercion and restriction by property owners against others."
Libertarianism harms economic growth,"Adam Smith's obvious and simple system of natural liberty is not a system of liberty at all, but a complicated network of restraints, imposed in part by individuals, but very largely by the government itself at the behest of others on the freedom of the some. ... What in fact distinguishes this counterfeit system of laissez-faire (the market) from paternalism, is not the absence of restraint, but the absence of any conscious purpose of the part of the officials who administer the restraint, and of any responsibility or unanimity on the part of the numerous owners at whose discretion the restraint is administered."
Libertarianism harms economic growth,"Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally."
Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off,"For Christmas 2000, Levin published a libertarian critique of Dickens's popular novella A Christmas Carol in which he defends Scrooge as an entrepreneur whose ideas and practices benefit his employees, society at large, and himself. "
Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off,"Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery."
Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off,"According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale."
Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off,"In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs."
Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal,"Rothbard criticized the frenzied nihilism of left-wing libertarians, but also criticized right-wing libertarians who were content to rely only on education to bring down the state; he believed that libertarians should adopt any moral tactic available to them in order to bring about liberty."
Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal,"Jeffrey Friedman argues that natural-rights libertarianism's justification for the primacy of property is incoherent: [W]e can press on from [the observation that libertarianism is egalitarian] to ask why, if ... the liberty of a human being to own another should be trumped by equal human rights, the liberty to own large amounts of property [at the expense of others] should not also be trumped by equal human rights. This alone would seem definitively to lay to rest the philosophical case for libertarianism. ... The very idea of ownership contains the relativistic seeds of arbitrary authority: the arbitrary authority of the individual's right to do wrong."
Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal,"This is even more vividly seen when we look at an actual historical occurrence. In the nineteenth century American slaveholders were finally legally coerced into doing what they were already morally required to do: free their slaves. In many cases this led to the slave owners' financial and social ruin: they lost their farms, their money, and their power. Of course they didn't agree to their personal ruin; they didn't agree to this restriction on their freedom. Morally they didn't have to consent; it was a remedy long overdue. Even the libertarian would agree. The slave holders' freedom was justifiably restricted by the presence of other people; the fact that there were other persons limited their acceptable alternatives. But that is exactly what the libertarian denies. Freedom, he claims, cannot be justifiably restricted without consent. In short, the difficulty in this: the libertarian talks as if there can be no legitimate non‑consensual limitations on freedom, yet his very theory involves just such limitations. Not only does this appear to be blatantly inconsistent, but even if he could avoid this inconsistency, there appears to be no principled way in which he can justify only his theory's non-consensual limitations on freedom."
Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal,"Libertarians often argue that a free market will naturally lead to economic prosperity for all, but many critics argue that this trickle-down theory is based on flawed assumptions and has not been supported by empirical evidence. For example, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that income inequality has increased in most OECD countries over the past few decades, despite the rise of neoliberal policies that promote free markets and limited government intervention."
Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal,"Libertarians often argue that individual freedom and property rights should be the primary values of society, but many critics argue that this emphasis on individualism ignores the importance of social cooperation and can lead to unjust outcomes. For example, philosopher Michael Walzer argues that individual freedom must be balanced against social equality and the common good."
Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal,"Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address."
Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services,University of Chicago economist John Cochrane echoed this assessment by noting the political dangers of libertarians for Sanders position.
Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services,"Meyer argued that utilitarian libertarians today use court power to force freedom ends with such vague phrases as due process and equal protection and manipulating utopian versions of freedom of the press, religion and speech. Pure libertarians assume they know what freedom is and that the state should enforce their vision through the courts."
Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services,"Outside the United States, libertarian generally refers to anti-authoritarian anti-capitalist ideologies."
Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services,"In general, libertarians strongly oppose violent revolution as unethical and counterproductive, although others, especially market anarchists of a left-wing persuasion such as agorists, advocate various forms of nonviolent resistance, tax resistance or evasion, public acts of civic disloyalty and disobedience, counter-economics and subversive black markets."
Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services,The split was finalized in 1971 when conservative leader William F.

Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services,"Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control."
The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens,"Thatcherism is associated with libertarianism within the Conservative Party, albeit one of libertarian ends achieved by using strong and sometimes authoritarian leadership."
The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens,"According to Stephen Metcalf, Nozick expresses serious misgivings about capitalist libertarianism, going so far as to reject much of the foundations of the theory on the grounds that personal freedom can sometimes only be fully actualized via a collectivist politics and that wealth is at times justly redistributed via taxation to protect the freedom of the many from the potential tyranny of an overly selfish and powerful few [REF]."
The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens,"The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups"
The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens,"The government also plays a crucial role in enforcing contracts and property rights. Without government enforcement, individuals may be less likely to enter into contracts or invest in property, leading to a breakdown of the market system. For example, a study by the World Bank found that strong property rights and contract enforcement are key factors in promoting economic growth and development."
The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens,"The government is also essential in providing public goods and services such as infrastructure, education, and health care, which are crucial for the well-being and prosperity of citizens.

Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties,"Libertarians within YAF believed, for example, the military draft was a violation of the individual freedom the organization claimed to embrace."
Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties,"Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal."

Cloning can be used for organ replication,"One bioethicist, Jacob M. Appel of New York University, has gone so far as to argue that children cloned for therapeutic purposes such as to donate bone marrow to a sibling with leukemia may someday be viewed as heroes."
Cloning can be used for organ replication,"According to the World Health Organization, there is a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, and many people die while waiting for a suitable organ to become available."
Cloning can be used for organ replication,"Another argument is that cloning can be used to create customized organs that are specific to an individual's needs.

Cloning is not understood enough yet,President George W. Bush said that human cloning was deeply troubling to most Americans.
Cloning is not understood enough yet,"In a 1997 article in The New Republic entitled The Wisdom of Repugnance, Kass suggests that we should respect the revulsion most people feel about cloning human beings, just as we respect their supposed revulsion at incest and cannibalism. In crucial cases, he writes, repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it. Kass writes that modern ethical discourse, which emphasizes autonomy, equity, and utility, fails to provide the moral guidance that the modern world demands: Repugnance, here as elsewhere, revolts against the excesses of human willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound"

Cloning is unethical/anti-religious,Kass supports a universal ban on the cloning of humans on the grounds that cloning is an affront to morality and human dignity.
Cloning is unethical/anti-religious,"Through the act of creating another human being, Christians have also posed the question as to whether this would be too much like playing God. Not only this, but some Christian ethicists argue that human cloning would create substantial issues of identity and individuality.This could be seen through the confusion of the child resulting from cloning as to who his parents are, what connection he has to his genetic duplicate, etc."
Cloning is unethical/anti-religious,"On the other hand, according to a survey of Christian fundamentalist pastors, responses indicated a common account of human cloning as primarily reproductive in nature, proscribed by its violation of God's will and role.Many of these pastors acknowledged the reason for this violation being rooted in the religiously motivated view that human cloning is an example of scientists playing God."

The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence,"Guantanamo Bay was chosen as the best place for long-term detention for a host of legal operational and logistics reasons, that there was much more viable strategic consideration. It was designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. If the U.S. can get terrorists off the battlefield and into Guantanamo Bay, we can be presented with an unprecedented opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts these operations."
The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence,"We will continue to bring the world’s most dangerous terrorists to justice—and we will continue working to collect the vital intelligence we need to protect our country.  The current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA program.  But as more high-ranking terrorists are captured, the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical—and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to getting life-saving information"
The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence,"“The president has been really explicit ... that Gitmo is a very, very important tool,” Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to the president, said on Fox News this morning. It's also important to understand that Guantanamo Bay is an incredibly important intelligence asset."
The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence,The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is the single  greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror.
The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence,"Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility, with Leon Panetta, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, acknowledging that ``[c]learly some of it came from detainees and the interrogation of detainees . . .' and confirming that ``they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of those detainees'."
Detainees have the right to trial in US courts,"On Thursday, June 12, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Boumediene v. Bush [553 U.S. 723 (2008)] that detainees held at Guantánamo Bay have the rights to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts under the Constitution’s habeas corpus provision and to have access to a lawyer. "
Detainees have the right to trial in US courts,"Finding the federal habeas statute thus applied extraterritorially and was not dependent upon U.S. citizenship, Stevens concluded that detainees at Guantanamo were entitled to invoke the federal courts’ authority under § 2241."
Detainees have the right to trial in US courts,"In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled today that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in federal court and that congressional legislation has failed to provide a reasonable substitute for such a hearing."
Detainees have the right to trial in US courts,The US supreme court has ruled that prisoners seized as potential terrorists and held for more than two years in Guantánamo bay may challenge their captivity in US courts.
The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions,"Every branch of our government shares responsibility for Guantánamo’s ongoing damage to the human rights of detainees, our nation’s reputation, and national security. The president and his agencies have the power to end indefinite detention and close Guantánamo, ending this travesty rather than perpetuating it. However, the Trump administration has pledged to keep Guantánamo open, ignoring that it has been a catastrophic failure on every front."
The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions,"Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists. "
The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions,"After twenty years of operation, the Guantanamo experiment long ago tarnished the United States’ reputation as a global leader on human rights, said Michael Breen, President and CEP of Human Rights First. Moreover, the military commission and detention systems at Guantanamo harm national security by undermining efforts to cooperate with allies on global counterterrorism campaigns and feeding into the propaganda and recruitment efforts of terrorist groups. Guantanamo has proven itself to be a costly moral and strategic failure; after two disastrous and detrimental decades, it must finally be closed."
The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions,"Guantanamo has harmed the fight against terrorism. It has undermined international cooperation and alienated Muslim communities. And fourth, the moral authority of the United States has been severely compromised by Guantanamo's existence, with disastrous results for the U.S. government's ability to promote human rights abroad."
The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions,The facilities at Guantánamo have become emblematic of the gross human rights abuses perpetrated by the US government in the name of terrorism.
The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive,"The estimated annual cost of $540 million covers the 12-month period that ended last Sept. 30 and does not include expenses that have remained classified, presumably including a continued C.I.A. presence. But the figures show that running the range of facilities built up over the years has grown increasingly expensive even as the number of prisoners has declined."
The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive,"The U.S. military court and prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, have cost more than $6 billion to operate since opening nearly 18 years ago and still churn through more than $380 million a year despite housing only 40 prisoners today."
The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive,"In 2013, it cost about $2.7 million per prisoner (which is, admittedly, still a lot!), up from an estimate of $800,000 per prisoner in 2011. Factor in the age of some of the prisoners still there and the medical care they'll eventually need, and it's easy to see the $13 million figure going even higher."
The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive,"The cost of running Guantanamo Bay's prison and court system jumped by nearly $90 million from 2013 to 2018, even as the number of prisoners there has decreased. That is according to a new analysis from Carol Rosenberg at The New York Times."
The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive,"Since Congress decided to pursue austerity in 2011, it has chosen to spend at least $1.42 billion on the mission at Guantanamo, although it could have been accomplished for just $29.9 million."
The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive,"Simply by transferring the 84 detainees already cleared to leave Guantanamo, the United States could save nearly $2 billion over the next 10 years."
The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive,"As reporter Carole Rosenberg wrote in The New York Times on Monday, the total cost in 2018 for housing just 40 prisoners, paying the guards, and running the military tribunals there is morwe than $540 million, or roughly $13 million per prisoner."
The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners,"Over the years, many detainees have claimed that they were detained unlawfully, denied due process, and subjected to grave physical and psychological abuses—some amounting to torture—by their American captors. As a result, critics say, Guantanamo has undermined U.S. influence and moral authority in many parts of the world."
The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners,"Of the 39 detainees still held at Guantánamo , only nine have been charged, or convicted of crimes. Between 2002 and 2021, nine detainees died in custody, two from natural causes and seven reportedly committed suicide. None had been charged or convicted of a crime."
The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners,"By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured. "
The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners,"detainees at Guantanamo have been arbitrarily detained, physically abused, and even tortured. They have spent years without any fair legal process, held on the basis of secret evidence."
unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp,"On December 2, 2002, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approved various harsh techniques, including: “interrogator identity” (interrogator impersonates a citizen or interrogator from a country known for harsh treatment of prisoners); stress positions, such as standing, for up to four hours; isolation for up to 30 days, with extensions beyond 30 days upon Commanding General approval; deprivation of all light and auditory stimuli; hooding during transportation and questioning; 20-hour interrogations; the use of a prisoner’s individual phobias, such as fear of dogs, to induce stress; and light pushing."
unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp,"779 men have been taken to the facility since then. Of these, only seven have been convicted, including five as a result of pre-trial agreements under which they pleaded guilty in return for the possibility of release from the base. These men faced trial by 'military commission'. The proceedings did not meet fair trial standards."
unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp,"The CSRT applies a broad definition of enemy combatant that inevitably ensnares innocent people;  applies a presumption of guilt;  has no juries; disables prisoners from gathering exculpatory evidence;  prohibits prisoners from having lawyers;   and relies on hearsay, coerced confessions, and secret evidence to reach its judgment that a prisoner should be detained indefinitely."
unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp,"A government report describes the facility as having been “modified in such a way as to reduce as much outside stimuli as possible,” with doors that had been “sealed to a point that allows no light to enter the room.” Inside, the walls were “covered with white paint or paper to further eliminate objects the detainee may concentrate on.” There was an eyebolt for shackling him to the floor, and speakers for bombarding him with sound."
unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp,"Mr. Slahi endured some of the most brutal treatment there. Investigations by the Army, the Justice Department and the Senate largely corroborated his account of being deprived of sleep; beaten; shackled in painful positions; forced to drink large amounts of water; isolated in darkness and exposed to extreme temperatures; stripped and soaked in cold water; told that his mother might be sent to Guantánamo; and sexually assaulted by female interrogators."
unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp,"Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld later approved interrogation techniques in Guantánamo that included sleep deprivation, stress positions, nudity, sensory deprivation and threatening detainees with dogs. "
The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice,"Originally intended to be an “island outside the law” where terrorism suspects could be detained without process and interrogated without restraint, the prison and military commissions at Guantánamo Bay are catastrophic failures. At home and around the world, Guantánamo has become a symbol of injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. "
The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice,"Around the world, Guantánamo is a symbol of racial and religious injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. Our government’s embrace of systematic torture shattered lives, shredded this country’s reputation in the world, and compromised national security. To this day, it has refused to release the full details of the torture program or to provide justice and redress for all the many victims."
The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice,Guantánamo Bay has become a world-wide symbol of injustice and oppression which has tarnished America’s international reputation and has served as a recruitment tool for future insurgents.

Nuclear weapons is essential for protection and deterrence,"Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) argues that two superpowers with nuclear weapons won't strike each other due to the fear that the counterstrikes from both parties will annihilate each other, which was the concept behind the Cold War."
Nuclear weapons is essential for protection and deterrence,"The Cold War was a period of tension between the US and the Soviet Union following World War II through the 1980s. There were no physical battles between the superpowers. However, both were hostile to each other through proxy wars, threats, and propaganda - almost leading up to a nuclear war. Nevertheless, due to nuclear deterrence, no nuclear weapons were deployed."
Nuclear weapons is essential for protection and deterrence,"This was clearly demonstrated in The Cuban Missile Crisis: the United States threatened to use nuclear weapons on Cuba if the Soviet Union did not remove its nuclear missiles. However, in fear of retaliation, the United States never struck, even though the United States was in possession of 17 times more nuclear weapons than the Soviet Union."
Nuclear weapons is essential for protection and deterrence,"Deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years."
Nuclear weapons is essential for protection and deterrence,"The invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as that country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. On the contrary, it confirmed that countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack. The possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them: the West does not intervene in Ukraine; Moscow spares their territory."
Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands,"The White House has announced recently that it has reason to believe Russia is willing to use chemical weapons in its ongoing conflict with Ukraine. There have also been reports that Russia has been using illegal weapons in Ukraine such as vacuum bombs and cluster munitions. If Putin is willing to shirk international laws to get what he wants, there is a very real possibility that he will do the same with laws regarding nuclear missiles."
Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands,"There are 2,000 metric tonnes of weapons-usable nuclear material that is highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium, said Deepti Choubey, senior director of nuclear and bio-security at the Nuclear Threat Initiative in Washington. These are the materials that a terrorist would use to make a kind of bomb that you would use for nuclear terrorism attacks and they are currently spread across hundreds of sites in 25 countries around the world."
Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands,"Bart Dal, adviser for nuclear security and safeguards at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said terrorism had increased since September 2011 – meaning the whole nuclear world has to improve security. “Imagine what the effect would be if they [terrorists] succeeded,” he said. “The consequences are so large that we have to take this into account. If you expose a nuclear weapon in one city or more, that would change our lives forever.”"
Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands,"Cause for concern, said Jonathan Herbach, a research fellow in nuclear security and arms control law at Utrecht University in The Netherlands, was the theft or loss of nuclear materials, some of which were sometimes never recovered. “These materials aren’t going away and more states are interested in developing them,” said Mr Herbach."
Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands,"Recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Even if this is the “sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies”, history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare, or working to prevent nuclear weapons falling into the “wrong hands”, has never been the top priority."
Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands,"Accidents and errors are of course not the only possible path that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. There is the risk of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons. There is the risk of nuclear terrorism, possibly after a terrorist organization steals weapons. There is the possibility that hackers can take control of the nuclear chain of command. And there is the possibility that several of these factors play a role at the same time."
Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands,"Ariel Conn: Richard Nixon's depression is the scariest to me because that's something that could happen at any time to any president. It's not dependent on external conflicts with other countries, but internal, personal conflicts that the rest of the world may or may not know about. As mental health becomes a more recognized issue, it's increasingly apparent that no one can really be trusted with nuclear weapons."
Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action,"On 21 September 2022, Mr Putin announced a “partial mobilisation” of Russian citizens to serve in the war in Ukraine. He also accused NATO members of making statements about “the possibility and admissibility of using weapons of mass destruction—nuclear weapons—against Russia”. He threatened to escalate the conflict if, in defence of Ukraine, any attacks were launched on Russian territory: In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff."
Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action,"If there had been a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries in Asia and Europe, Hunter said. The Pentagon estimated that there would have been 275 million deaths in Russia and China, with 50 million more dead in another six months—roughly half the populations of both countries at the time. Another 100 million would have died in Eastern European satellite countries, and 100 million more would have died in Western Europe due to radioactive fallout and Russian short-range missiles that survived the initial attack."
Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action,"More than 91 million people in Russia, the US, and other NATO countries might be killed or injured within three hours following a single nuclear warning shot, according to a terrifying simulation. "
Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action,"Max Tegmark: Soviet Sub Captain Decides to Fire Nuclear Torpedo During Cuban Missile Crisis To me, this is both harrowing and educational: it shows how great risk can come from the combination of many separate unfortunate coincidences and misunderstandings that couldn’t start a nuclear war on their own, but can provide the perfect storm when combined. The fact that it remained secret for decades also suggests that there may be recent scary incidents that we haven’t yet heard of. "
Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action,"David Stanley: Lost Contact with 50 Missiles To me this is the scariest because, unlike the other events, this could potentially have led to an accidental launch of ICBMs rather than just a false alarm of an incoming attack. Additionally, the fact that it happened so recently highlights that our present safeguards are not necessarily more robust than those from 50 years ago."
Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action,"Anthony Aguirre: Perhaps it’s breaking the rules, but I would say the constellation of incidents *around* (and including) the Cuban missile crisis — so many!  It suggests that (a) when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences etc. will conspire to create big problems (like “Soviet Sub Captain…Crisis”) and (b) we were *very* lucky to get through the Cuban Missile crisis, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would make it through any similar flare-up in tensions."

Urbanization benefits the economy,"For example, they argue that industrialization supports greater efficiency of agriculture through technology, an advantage for the productivity of rural farmers as well as urban consumers."
Urbanization benefits the economy,"Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt."
Urbanization benefits the environment,"In his book Whole Earth Discipline, Stewart Brand argues that the effects of urbanization are primarily positive for the environment."
Urbanization benefits the environment,Biodiversity will play an increasingly important role within the urban landscape.
Urbanization benefits the environment,"Urbanization is immensely altering public health problems, particularly for the poor, by directing it towards non-communicable diseases, accidental and violent injuries, and death and health impacts from ecological disaster."
Urbanization benefits the environment,"Urbanization brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas. The same output can be produced using fewer resources with urban agglomeration than without. In this sense, urbanization reduces the ecological footprint."
Urbanization benefits the environment,"Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy."
Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially,"European cities were rapidly urbanizing and sanitation was becoming an increasingly serious problem, whilst at the same time the cities themselves were becoming an increasingly important source of agricultural nutrients."
Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially,The continuation of the economic decline combined with the increased population and urbanization led to decrease of agrarian production.
Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially,"Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85%-among the highest in Latin America-and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer."
Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially,"Protection of this natural resource eliminated the causes (i.e., income risk and health effects) that facilitate rural to urban migration by protecting a natural resource base by which rural residents in India depended for their existence."
Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially,"Restrictions to rural-urban migration protected the urban workers from competition from the rural workers, which therefore also contributed to rural-urban disparities."
Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially,The rural quality of Laos implicates the provision of education as urbanization facilitates educational delivery.
Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially,The idea that rural-push factors are stronger than urban-pull factors in cases of overurbanization suggests that it is population pressure in rural areas rather than the pull of urban jobs that leads to rural-urban migration.
Urbanization causes crime,"MÄori leaders and government policymakers alike struggled to deal with social issues stemming from increased urban migration, including a shortage of housing and jobs, and a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems."
Urbanization causes crime,"Regardless of urbanicity, areas of concentrated poverty tend to have higher crime rates, underperforming schools, poor housing, poor health conditions, limited private services, and few job opportunities."

Urbanization harms the environment,"The most significant threats to tortoises include urbanization, disease, habitat destruction and fragmentation, illegal collection and vandalism by humans, and habitat conversion from invasive plant species (Brassica tournefortii, Bromus rubens and Erodium spp.)"
Urbanization harms the environment,"As internal migration by farmers looking for better-paying jobs in urban hubs causes a significant rural-urban inequality gap (the owners of firms would be profiting, while laborers from those industries would see their incomes rise at a much slower rate and agricultural workers would possibly see their incomes decrease), rural populations decrease as urban populations increase."
Urbanization harms the environment,"The rapid economic growth, industrialization and urbanization are associated with a strong increase in energy demand and emissions of air pollutants including sulfur dioxide (see also acid rain) and hydrogen sulfide, which may affect plant metabolism."
Urbanization harms the environment,"Urbanization, deforestation, and agricultural activities largely contribute sediment and nutrient inputs to coastal waters via rivers."
Urbanization harms the environment,The rapid environmental changes that follow urbanization are increasing the prevalence of the major risk factors for chronic disease.

Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources,"The urbanization of small and medium-sized towns has created different challenges for ethnically diverse areas, leading in some cases to an ethnic stratification of labor and greater potential for ethnic conflict."
Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources,The drive for rapid urban growth and often efficiency can lead to less equitable urban development.
Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources,"As for the schools in urban areas, significant urban migration has meant that the supply of schools in urban areas have not managed to keep up with the increasing demand; leading to overcrowding in urban schools."
Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources,"The fast urbanization of Tagum from the late '80s to 1990 which was attributed to the mushrooming of business establishments and other commercial activities, increasing population and services and other factors, has caused various problems and needs, like roads, drainage, the increasing numbers of squatters, upscaling trend of traffic congestion in major streets, garbage and sanitation, land use and others."

Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources,"Although comprehensive data on regional famine severity does not exist, the available evidence indicates that the severe movement restrictions, the proximity to agricultural production and the level of urbanization were crucial factors of famine mortality."
Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources,"Some scholars suggest that urbanization creates slums because local governments are unable to manage urbanization, and migrant workers without an affordable place to live in, dwell in slums."
Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences,"Abstention from voting is a form of exercising one's right to vote. When someone confirms that they are abstaining from voting, it means they are voting neither for nor against the motion at hand. Nevertheless, they are still taking part in the elections, but have expressed neither approval nor disapproval for a particular candidate, party or motion."
Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences,"An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion."
Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences,"In parliamentary procedure, a member may be required to abstain in the case of a real or perceived conflict of interest."
Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences,"In support for this non-political strategy, some non-voters claim that voting does not make any positive difference. If voting changed anything, they’d make it illegal is an oft-cited sentiment attributed to anarchist Emma Goldman."
Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences,"In addition to strategic non-voters, there are also ethical non-voters, those who reject voting outright, not merely as an ineffective tactic for change, but moreover because they view the act as either a grant of consent to be governed by the state, a means of imposing illegitimate control over one's countrymen, or both. Thus, this view holds that through voting, one necessarily finds themselves violating the non-aggression principle."
Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences,"Herbert Spencer noted that whether a person votes for the winning candidate, votes for a losing candidate, or abstains from voting, he will be deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate, if they were to follow the doctrine of Blackstone of which Spencer stated A rather awkward doctrine this."
Citizens have a right not to vote,"Another argument against compulsory voting, prevalent among legal scholars in the United States, is that it is essentially a compelled speech act, which violates freedom of speech because the freedom to speak necessarily includes the freedom not to speak."
Citizens have a right not to vote,"Peter Singer, in Democracy and Disobedience, argues that compulsory voting could negate the obligation of a voter to support the outcome of the election, since voluntary participation in elections is deemed to be one of the sources of the obligation to obey the law in a democracy."
Citizens have a right not to vote,"Minchin was a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, and supported the abolition of Australia's compulsory voting system, on the stated basis that compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of .. civil liberties."
Citizens have a right not to vote,Many opponents of compulsory participation worry about imposing penalties on non-voters.
Citizens have a right not to vote,Citizens have the right to choose whether they want to vote. Compulsion is part of a slippery slope to totalitarianism.
Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner,A 2016 study of the Netherlands found that the abolition of compulsory voting increased the vote share of Dutch social democratic parties while reducing the vote share of minor and extreme parties.
Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner,Making voting compulsory has a direct and dramatic effect on turnout.
Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner,Compulsory registration and voting reduce the legitimacy of elected representatives. Majorities in Australian elections include the votes of many uninterested and ill-informed people who vote just because they have to.
Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner,"It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ."
Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner,"gnoring the wishes of most voters. Since uninformed voters are more easily persuaded, some politicians may choose to focus on marginal voters and ignore their main base of support . Even if compulsory voting leads to less polarization, it may not result in better policy outcomes because complicated and nuanced legislation may be perceived negatively by swing voters."
Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner,Dampening the voice of the majority. An additional concern under a compulsory system is that people who are uninformed (or simply do not care about the outcome of an election) may end up voting randomly. The impact of ‘random’ votes ends up being particularly detrimental because it fails to increase civic engagement and may skew election results.
Not everyone has the ability to go to vote,"Voters tend to mean well, but voting well takes more than a kind heart. It requires tremendous social scientific knowledge: knowledge that most citizens lack. Most voters know nothing, but some know a great deal, and some know less than nothing."
Not everyone has the ability to go to vote,"It’s true (at least right now) that certain demographic groups (such as rich white men) are more likely to pass a basic political knowledge test than others (such as poor black women). Hence the worry that epistocracies will favour the interests of some groups over others. But this worry might be overstated. Political scientists routinely find that so long as individual voters have a low chance of being decisive, they vote for what they perceive to be the common good rather than their self-interest. Further, it might well be that excluding or reducing the power of the least knowledgeable 75 per cent of white people produces better results for poor black women than democracy does."
Not everyone has the ability to go to vote,"Democracy and epistocracy both spread power among the many, but epistocracy tries to make sure the informed many are not drowned out by the ignorant or misinformed many."
Not everyone has the ability to go to vote,"A recent poll showed most Americans don’t know basic facts about the Constitution. (A third of respondents couldn’t name a single branch of government or a single right protected by the Bill of Rights.) Even worse, people may be voting based on intentional disinformation."
Not everyone has the ability to go to vote,"Over the years, surveys have tracked the surprisingly low level of voter knowledge. A 2010 survey found a third of respondents couldn’t tell if the Civil War came before or after the War of Independence. And today, one in five adults say they get most of their political news from social media, which often carries deliberate misinformation from domestic or foreign sources."
Not everyone has the ability to go to vote,"The chronic need for better educated voters causes an inherent problem in democracies, according to Jennifer Hochschild, professor of government at Harvard. In 2010, she noted all democracies believe informed voters are essential to good government while they continually extend suffrage to greater proportions of their people. But this tends to bring less informed voters into the electorate, which led to her ask, If democracies need informed voters, how can they thrive while expanding enfranchisement?"
Compulsory voting increases representation,A 2016 study finds that compulsory voting reduces the gender gap in electoral engagement in several ways.
Compulsory voting increases representation,"The revisions to the constitution introduced universal suffrage and compulsory voting, adopted proportional representation, and limited the sovereignty of the Luxembourg monarch. "
Compulsory voting increases representation,A study of a Swiss canton where compulsory voting was enforced found that compulsory voting significantly increased electoral support for leftist policy positions in referenda by up to 20 percentage points.
Compulsory voting increases representation,"Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation. "
Compulsory voting increases representation,Compulsory voting does not force a choice. People can always lodge a blank or spoiled ballot paper.
Compulsory voting increases representation,"Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated."
Compulsory voting increases representation,"Voting appears to be a socialized behaviour learned early in life. Therefore, if the young fail to vote when they reach the age of majority, it is possible that they will remain forever disengaged from the political system."
Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics,"Since voting at referendums in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory has been allowed in 1977, compulsory voting has also applied there.  "
Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics,"Concerns about declining democratic engagement and participation have been raised by the Electoral Commission, and by commentators such as Geoffrey Palmer and Andrew Butler, leading some to support the introduction of compulsory voting, as exists in Australia."
Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics,"Other perceived advantages to compulsory voting are the stimulation of broader interest politics, as a sort of civil education and political stimulation, which creates a better informed population, although no studies have been undertaken to demonstrate that the populations of Belgium or Australia for instance, where compulsory voting has long existed, are better informed and more politically aware than the populations of New Zealand, France, Canada or the Scandinavian countries, where voting has never been compulsory."
Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics,The discontinuation of mandatory voting and voter apathy may have been significant factors contributing to the reduction in the number of voters.
Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics,"Compulsory registration and voting increase the legitimacy of elected representatives. Candidates winning seats in parliament really do win a majority of the people’s votes. In countries like the United States, where the turnout can be low, candidates can win with much less than a majority of the eligible vote."
Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics,Compulsory voting increases the political education of the people. They will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote.
People have an obligation to vote,"In 1942, compulsory voting (but not enrolment) was introduced, and first took effect at the 1944 election, with an increase in voter turnout from 51% to 89%."
People have an obligation to vote,"Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, even though voting was still voluntary."
People have an obligation to vote,"The European Court of Human Rights, in the 1971 case of X v Austria, ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, because only attendance at a polling station - and not voting itself - is compulsory, while the voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper."
People have an obligation to vote,"A counter argument to opponents of compulsory voting is that in these systems the individual still has the practical ability to abstain at the polls by voting informally if they so choose, due to the secrecy of the ballot."
People have an obligation to vote,"Supporters of compulsory voting argue that voting addresses the paradox of voting, which is that for a rational, self-interested voter, the costs of voting will normally exceed the expected benefits."
People have an obligation to vote,Voter turnout during elections is not much of a problem in Thailand as voting is compulsory and is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution a citizen must exercise.
People have an obligation to vote,"Johnson said: Voting is one of our most important rights. African Americans and women fought for years to gain that right in the U.S. And in some countries, people still face barriers, or difficulties, when trying to vote. People who can vote but don’t are taking that right for granted."
Cannabis harms the body,"Dutch research has however shown that an increase of THC content also increase the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers, who do not adapt their smoking-style to the higher THC content."
Cannabis harms the body,"According to a World Health Organisation report: As cannabis is an illegal drug its cultivation, harvesting and distribution are not subject to quality control mechanisms to ensure the reliability and safety of the product used by consumers. It is well recognised in developing countries, such as Kenya, that illicit alcohol production can result in the contamination with toxic by-products or adulterants that can kill or seriously affect the health of users. The same may be true of illicit drugs such as opiates, cocaine and amphetamine in developed societies."
Cannabis harms the body,"A 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana (138 joints per week) changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke."
Cannabis harms the body,"According to Janet D. Lapey, M.D., of Concerned Citizens For Drug Prevention, Due to a placebo effect, a patient may erroneously believe a drug is helpful when it is not. This is especially true of addictive, mind-altering drugs like marijuana. A marijuana withdrawal syndrome occurs, consisting of anxiety, depression, sleep and appetite disturbances, irritability, tremors, diaphoresis, nausea, muscle convulsions, and restlessness. Often, persons using marijuana erroneously believe that the drug is helping them combat these symptoms without realizing that actually marijuana is the cause of these effects."
Cannabis harms the body,"In 1973, a report by the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse entitled Marijuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding found marijuana does not cause violent or aggressive behavior, but rather marijuana was usually found to inhibit the expression of aggressive impulses by pacifying the user, interfering with muscular coordination, reducing psychomotor activities and generally producing states of drowsiness lethargy, timidity and passivity."
Cannabis harms the body,"For example, the Board representative is quoted as having said that we might end up in the next 10 or 20 years with our psychiatric hospitals filled with people who have problems with cannabis, and that a recent study by the British Lung Foundation found smoking three cannabis joints caused the same damage to the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes."
Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents,Anslinger claimed cannabis caused people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual.
Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents,A 2012 meta-analysis found that acute cannabis use increased the risk of an automobile crash.
Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents,"Studies have shown that the risk of being involved in a crash increases after marijuana use. Driving while impaired by any substance is dangerous. The delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contained in marijuana is a psychoactive (mind-altering) compound that affects areas of the brain that control the body’s movements, balance, coordination, memory, and judgment. It can impair coordination, distort perception, and lead to memory loss and difficulty in problem-solving. Specific to driving, THC can slow reaction times and reduce the ability to make decisions."
Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents,"more states legalize its medical and recreational use. Managing motor vehicle crash risks associated with marijuana impairment is important, as marijuana impacts a driver’s cognitive abilities. Other than alcohol, marijuana is the most frequently reported drug found in post-crash testing."
Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents,"In a new study published in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers are noticing a pattern that suggests alcohol might not be the only culprit of impaired driving. Researchers from Boston Medical Center, Boston University, and the University of Victoria in British Columbia found that deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the United States in the past two decades, as have car crash deaths involving just cannabis. "
Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents,"Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent."
Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive,"In 2006, the Karolinska Institute in Sweden used twelve rats to examine how adolescent use of cannabis affects subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs. The study gave six of the twelve teenage rats a small dose of THC, reportedly equivalent to one joint smoked by a human, every three days. The rats were allowed to administer heroin by pushing a lever and the study found the rats given THC took larger doses of heroin. The institute examined the brain cells in the rats and found THC alters the opioid system that is associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of opiates on rat's brain and thus causes them to use more heroin."
Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive,Multiple opponents of cannabis decriminalization have claimed increased cannabis use results in increased abuse of other illicit drugs.
Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive,The World Health Organization noted that any gateway effect associated with marijuana use may actually be due to marijuana prohibition because exposure to other drugs when purchasing cannabis on the black-market increases the opportunity to use other illicit drugs.
Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive,"The Department of Justice also considers the fact that people are willing to risk scholastic, career, and legal problems to use cannabis to be evidence of its high potential for abuse."
Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive,"For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease."
Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive,"A 2008 study concluded that, based on US data from the period 2000-2002, adolescent-onset (defined here as ages 11-17) usage of hallucinogenic drugs (including psilocybin) did not increase the risk of drug dependence in adulthood; this was in contrast to adolescent usage of cannabis, cocaine, inhalants, anxiolytic medicines, and stimulants, all of which were associated with an excess risk of developing clinical features associated with drug dependence."
Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive,"In December 2002, a study by RAND investigating whether cannabis use results in the subsequent use of cocaine and heroin was published in the British Journal of Addiction. The researchers created a mathematical model simulating adolescent drug use. National rates of cannabis and hard drug use in the model matched survey data collected from representative samples of youths from across the United States; the model produced patterns of drug use and abuse. The study stated:.   The people who are predisposed to use drugs and have the opportunity to use drugs are more likely than others to use both marijuana and harder drugs .. Marijuana typically comes first because it is more available. Once we incorporated these facts into our mathematical model of adolescent drug use, we could explain all of the drug use associations that have been cited as evidence of marijuana's gateway effect .. We've shown that the marijuana gateway effect is not the best explanation for the link between marijuana use and the use of harder drugs."
Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive,"In 1985, Gabriel G. Nahas published Keep Off the Grass, which stated that the biochemical changes induced by marijuana in the brain result in drug-seeking, drug taking behavior, which in many instances will lead the user to experiment with other pleasurable substances. The risk of progression from marijuana to cocaine to heroin is now well documented."
Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive,"Proponents cite studies such as that of 311 same sex twins, where only one twin smoked cannabis before age 17, and where such early cannabis smokers were five times more likely than their twin to move on to harder drugs."

Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children,"Despite more than $7 billion spent annually towards arresting and prosecuting nearly 800,000 people across the country for marijuana offenses in 2005, the federally funded Monitoring the Future Survey reports about 85% of high school seniors find marijuana easy to obtain. That figure has remained virtually unchanged since 1975, never dropping below 82.7% in three decades of national surveys"
Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children,"Despite over $7 billion spent annually towards arresting[REF] and prosecuting nearly 800,000 people across the country for marijuana offenses in 2005 (FBI Uniform Crime Reports), the federally funded Monitoring the Future Survey reports about 85% of high school seniors find marijuana easy to obtain. That figure has remained virtually unchanged since 1975, never dropping below 82.7% in three decades of national surveys."
Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children,"In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable."
Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children,Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. This led Alaska's residents to vote to re-criminalize marijuana in 1990.
Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children,"The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has claimed that cannabis decriminalization will lead to increased cannabis use and addiction in the un-sourced pamphlet entitled Speaking Out Against Drug Legalization. The pamphlet states in 1979, after 11 states decriminalized private cannabis use, cannabis use among 12th grade students was almost 51 percent and in 1992, when stricter cannabis laws were put in place, the usage rate reduced to 22 percent. The pamphlet also states that when Alaska decriminalized cannabis in 1975, the cannabis use rate among youth eventually rose to twice the national average youth usage rate nationwide"
Legal cannabis will boost the black-market/criminal activity,"Gil Kerlikowske, director of the US Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) argues that in the United States, illegal drugs already cost $180 billion a year in health care, lost productivity, crime, and other expenditures, and that number would only increase under legalization because of increased use."
Legal cannabis will boost the black-market/criminal activity,The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has claimed that cannabis leads to increased crime in the unsourced pamphlet entitled Speaking Out Against Drug Legalization.
Legal cannabis will boost the black-market/criminal activity,"Take California for example: first in the nation to legalize the medical use of the drug in 1996, the state would go on to legalize recreational use in 2016. But in just the past year, the state reported several massive illegal cannabis busts, with 20 tons of cannabis confiscated off a series of farms, $8 million worth of plants found in a thought-abandoned warehouse alongside a busy highway, and 100+ illegal operations busted in the southern town of Anza – just over the last three or four months."
Legal cannabis will boost the black-market/criminal activity,"Police reports suggest that arrests for pot crimes have increased following the drug’s legalization. Among such reports are a series of police records secured by the Los Angeles Times in early 2019 – compared to the rates of cannabis smuggling from before legalization was implemented, the documents suggest that arrests have risen as much as 166%  since 1996."
Legal cannabis will boost the black-market/criminal activity,"The marijuana black market has continued to thrive to the point where legitimate growers and sellers are struggling to stay afloat in areas of the country awash in illegal weed. In California, for example, the illegal weed market is “indisputably many times larger than the licensed community,” according to an analysis from the Los Angeles Times. That same report found that unlicensed farms outnumbered legal operations by as much as 10 to 1 in the state’s biggest cultivation areas."
Cannabis is financially beneficial,"In 2003, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) published Economic Costs of Drug Abuse, which stated without separately analyzing cannabis related costs, the United States was spending $12.1 billion on law enforcement and court costs, and $16.9 billion in corrections costs, totaling $29 billion."
Cannabis is financially beneficial,"Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation."
Cannabis is financially beneficial,"In 2004, Scott Bates of the Boreal Economic Analysis & Research center prepared a study for Alaskans for Rights & Revenues entitled The Economic Implications of Marijuana Legalization in Alaska. The study estimated the Alaskan government was spending $25-30 million per year enforcing cannabis prohibition laws. The study found if the purchase of cannabis were to be taxed as a legal commodity, tax revenues would increase by about $10-20 million per year, making $35-50 million per year in funds available."
Cannabis is financially beneficial,"The State Board of Equalization estimated that imposing a $50 per ounce levy on cannabis sales could generate $1.4 billion a year in new tax revenue, thus generating a large amount of revenue at a time when the state was experiencing financial pressure. This estimate came from the BOE's 2009 analysis of California Assembly Bill 390 based on a 2006 report entitled Marijuana Production in the United States. These statistics were based on production estimates derived from marijuana eradication efforts from 2003 to 2005."
Cannabis is financially beneficial,"The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion."
Cannabis is financially beneficial,"In 1988, Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya published Savings in California Marijuana Law Enforcement Costs Attributable to the Moscone Act of 1976 in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. The study estimated California saved almost one billion dollars in a twelve-year period between 1976 and 1988, as a result of the Moscone Act of 1976 that decriminalized cannabis."
Cannabis is financially beneficial,"Supporters also argued that passing the measure would result in additional benefits including tourism and spinoff industries such as cafes and paraphernalia. Based on California's wine industry, proponents of this theory anticipated that legalizing marijuana in the state could generate up to $18 billion, including the creation of 60,000-110,000 jobs."
Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief,"A study published in the March 1, 1990 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences stated that there are virtually no reports of fatal cannabis overdose in humans and attributed this safety to the low density of cannabinoid receptors in areas of the brain controlling breathing and the heart."

Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief,"Gettman argues further that since laboratory animals do not self-administer cannabis, and because cannabis' toxicity is virtually non-existent compared to that of heroin or cocaine, cannabis lacks the high abuse potential required for inclusion in Schedule I or II."
Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief,"In 1999, a study by the Division of Neuroscience and Behavioral Health at the Institute of Medicine entitled Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base, found no evidence of a link between cannabis use and the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs on the basis of its particular physiological effect."
Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief,"In 1999, a study by the Division of Neuroscience and Behavioral Health at the Institute of Medicine entitled Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base, concluded there is little evidence that decriminalization of marijuana use necessarily leads to a substantial increase in marijuana use."
Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief,"In his petition, Gettman also argues that cannabis is an acceptably safe medication. He notes that a 1999 Institute of Medicine report found that except for the harms associated with smoking, the adverse effects of marijuana use are within the range of effects tolerated for other medications. He points out that there are a number of delivery routes that were not considered by the Institute, such as transdermal, sublingual, and even rectal administration, in addition to vaporizers, which release cannabis' active ingredients into the air without burning the plant matter."
Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief,"On July 10, 1995, Jon Gettman and High Times Magazine filed another rescheduling petition with the DEA. This time, instead of focusing on cannabis' medical uses, the petitioners claimed that cannabis did not have the high potential for abuse required for Schedule I or Schedule II status. They based their claims on studies of the brain's cannabinoid receptor system conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) between 1988 and 1994. In particular, they claim that a 1992 study by M. Herkenham et al., using a lesion-technique, established that there are no cannabinoid receptors in the dopamine-producing areas of the brain."

Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief,"On September 6, 1988, DEA Chief Administrative Law Judge Francis L. Young ruled that cannabis did not meet the legal criteria of a Schedule I prohibited drug and should be reclassified. He declared that cannabis in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man."
Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief,THC is typically considered the primary active component of the cannabis plant; various scientific studies have suggested that certain other cannabinoids like CBD may also play a significant role in its psychoactive effects.
If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated,"In 2004, a study entitled The Limited Relevance of Drug Policy: Cannabis in Amsterdam and in San Francisco, found strict laws against cannabis use have a low impact on usage rates."
If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated,"In 2006, a study by the University of California, Los Angeles found California has saved $2.50 for every dollar invested into Proposition 36, which decriminalized cannabis and other drug possession charges by allowing out patient treatment programs instead of incarceration. In the first year the proposition was enacted (2001), California reportedly saved $173 million, which is likely a result of fewer drug offenders in prison. In the five years after the program was enacted, 8,700 fewer people are in prison for drug offenses."
If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated,"In 1997, the Connecticut Law Revision Commission examined states that had decriminalized cannabis and found any increase in cannabis usage was less than the increase in states that have not decriminalized cannabis; furthermore, the commission stated the largest proportionate increase [of cannabis use] occurred in those states with the most severe penalties"
If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated,"British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years."
If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated,"In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations."
People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies,"Peter Reuter, a professor at the School of Public Policy and the Department of Criminology at the University of Maryland, College Park, said that experimenting with marijuana has long been a normal part of growing up in the U.S.; about half of the population born since 1960 has tried the drug by age 21."
People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies,A further study in 2002 found that cannabis was being used regularly by 67% of males and 22% of females aged 13 to 36.
People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies,"Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant."
People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies,"Dennis Kucinich, a U.S. representative from Ohio and 2008 presidential candidate, has been an advocate of cannabis legalization. During Kucinich's 2004 presidential campaign, the following was posted on Kucinich's official campaign web site [REF]. Most marijuana users do so responsibly, in a safe, recreational context. These people lead normal, productive lives - pursuing careers, raising families and participating in civic life .. A Kucinich administration would reject the current paradigm of 'all use is abuse' in favor of a drug policy that sets reasonable boundaries for marijuana use by establishing guidelines similar to those already in place for alcohol"
People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies,"I may have an important and legitimate reason for harming my body, something I feel outweighs the pain I cause myself. For instance, I may be seeking spiritual enrichment through mortification of the flesh, or I might just feel that the ends justify the means – for instance, missing a few nights of sleep to get an essay finished on time. Why should someone else who has totally different beliefs and values to me and doesn’t understand why I don’t value my physical shell get to dictate to me what I can and can’t do with it?"
Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal,"In December 2006, a 12-year gateway drug hypothesis study on 214 boys from ages 10-12 by the American Psychiatric Association was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry. The study concluded adolescents who used cannabis prior to using other drugs, including alcohol and tobacco, were no more likely to develop a substance abuse disorder than subjects in the study who did not use cannabis prior to using other drugs."
Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal,"A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found.

Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal,"Psychopharmacologist David Nutt argues, though he is against full declassification, that the harm caused by cannabis is far less than that caused by alcohol or tobacco, which, if they were invented today would be illegal."
Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal,"Making marijuana legally available to adults on more or less the same terms as alcohol would tend to reduce crime, certainly by greatly shrinking the illicit market and possibly by reducing alcohol consumption via substitution if smoking marijuana acts, on balance, as a substitute for drinking alcohol rather than a complement to it since drinking seems to have a greater tendency to unleash aggression than does cannabis use."
Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal,"There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)."

Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity,The Connecticut Law Revision Commission made the following evaluation: (1) the costs of arresting and prosecuting marijuana offenders were significantly lower in states that had done away with criminal penalties for possessing small amounts; (2) there was a greater increase in marijuana use in states that continue to treat possession as crime than in states that treated it as a civil offense; (3) easing the penalties for marijuana did not lead to a substantial increase in the use of either alcohol or hard drugs.
Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity,The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime has also acknowledged the many unintended negative consequences of drug enforcement.
Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity,"Supporters argued that legalizing marijuana in California would help alleviate the drug war in Mexico. Based on the theory espoused by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that up to 60% of Mexican drug cartels' profits come from sales of marijuana, legalizing the drug in nearby California would drastically cut their funding. As a result, supporters of this argument believed that legalization would lead to a decrease in drug-related violent crime in Mexico."
Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity,"The editor of the British Medical Journal, Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles' call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir Ian Gilmore, former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs as a health issue rather than criminalising people and this could drastically reduce crime and improve health."
Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity,"Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary."

In both realms (sexuality and economics) men hold substantial and systematic power over women. In prostitution, these power disparities merge in an act which both assigns and reaffirms the dominant social status of men over the subordinated social status of women.The demand for commercial sex is often further grounded in social power disparities of race, nationality, caste and colour."

Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance,"Instead of policy expanding women's opportunities for gainful employment policy, from 1979 onward the one-child policy has added upon the son preference causing the largest number of missing women in any country."
Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance,"Some bioethicists believe that sex selection is an ethical problem and could be disruptive to society . Charles Lockwood of Yale says, a disproportionate number of female fetuses have been terminated worldwide, and a 2-to-1 male-to-female ratio could lead to social unrest and wars."
Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance,"When combined with frequent social sex selection, this bias may produce a gender imbalance that has undesirable consequences."
Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance,"The causes of the high sex ratio in China result from a combination of strong son preference, the one-child policy, easy access to sex-selective abortion, and discrimination against and abuses of females."
Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance,"According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys."
Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance,"Today, around 140 million women are believed to be missing around the world – the result of son preference, including gender-biased sex selection, a form of discrimination. Since the 1990s, some areas have seen up to 25 per cent more male births than female births. The rise in sex selection is alarming as it reflects the persistent low status of women and girls. The resulting gender imbalance also has a damaging effect on societies. "
Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance,"Ask any parent, especially fathers, what gender would they like to have for their first child, and you will likely get “male” as an answer. A survey in Hungary actually revealed that 87% of the 1,500 couples interviewed would want their first born to be male. In such case, we would be facing population imbalance, which could result to more problems."
Sex selection is against tradition,"Post-conceptual selection by preimplantation testing (PGD) also involves preferential use of embryos, and termination of pregnancy for gender selection also raises many ethical questions of the abortion debate."
Sex selection is against tradition,"A 2011 study by Kippen, Evans and Gray found that 80% of people were against allowing abortion for sex selection."
Sex selection is against tradition,"Child sex ratio greater than 115 boys per 100 girls is found in regions where the predominant majority is Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian; furthermore normal child sex ratio of 104 to 106 boys per 100 girls are also found in regions where the predominant majority is Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian. These data contradict any hypotheses that may suggest that sex selection is an archaic practice which takes place among uneducated, poor sections or particular religion of the Indian society."
Sex selection is against tradition,"Nature determines the gender or sex of a newborn. It is sheer chance and a process that is not fully understood. While there is an explanation why, how and when the sex is determined naturally, it is not within human control in the natural scheme of things. By choosing to opt for a certain gender and opting against another, it is interfering with what nature intends or intended to do. The natural selection process is impaired when you choose your baby’s gender."
Sex selection is against tradition,"Opponents of baby gender selection argue that by going for it, you are going against the laws of nature. That is, you are not only contravening the traditional way of conception by determining the law of nature."
Sex selection is expensive,"While one cycle of IVF treatments might run upwards of $10,000 in the United States, gender selection testing (PGD/PGS) can bring the tally up to $25,000. The steep cost increase is attributed to additional embryonic biopsies, medications, and aneuploidy testing to confirm chromosome normality."
Sex selection is expensive,"Another contention of critics is the high cost of scientifically implanting an embryo with a specific gender. The amount is around $20,000 on the treatment alone. This is on top of the other expenses the couple need to save for. They also refute the accuracy of the method since it is not 100%, except for the IV with PGD which is not allowed for every couple who dreams to have a child. This is only permitted on parents after they have passed the criteria like the need to prevent genetic issues."
Sex selection is expensive,"The technologies available do not guarantee accurate result, even IVF. A combination of IVF and PGD though does offer 100%, but then again, that would cost a lot of money. Are you sure you’re ready to break the bank?"
Sex selection is expensive,"Gender selection is expensive. Medical interventions can cost as much as twenty thousand or even more in some places. Also, there is no certainty that the process would be a success. Choosing your baby’s gender may not work out and you may end up with a futile financial investment."
Sex selection is expensive," The cost of PGD gender selection process is too high. It can cost you up to several thousand dollars. This is despite the fact that you are not absolutely guaranteed of success. Even then, the general rate of success if high."

Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases,Gender-biased sex selection (GBSS) is a result and an expression of cultural preference for sons.
Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases,"According to a 2011 Gallup poll, if they were only allowed to have one child, 40% of respondents said they would prefer a boy, while only 28% preferred a girl. When told about prenatal sex selection techniques such as sperm sorting and in vitro fertilization embryo selection, 40% of Americans surveyed thought that picking embryos by sex was an acceptable manifestation of reproductive rights. These selecting techniques are available at about half of American fertility clinics, as of 2006."
Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases,"Given strict family-size limitations and a preference for sons, girls have become unwanted in China because they are considered as depriving the parents of the possibility of having a son, while a deeply rooted son preference makes many families want a son."
Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases,"The combined factors of son preference, the one-child policy and the availability of prenatal sex-identification technology have allowed prenatal discrimination to spread since the mid-1980s in both urban and rural areas in China where abortion is legal."
Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases,"In addition, primary care physicians voiced the concerns that sex selection led to invasive medical interventions in the absence of therapeutic indications, contributed to gender stereotypes that could result in child neglect of the lesser-desired sex, and was not a solution to domestic violence."
Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases,"It is sometimes suggested that so-called 'family balancing'- whereby families with two or more children of one sex, choose a child of the opposite sex- is a less objectionable use of sex selection. However, it is not clear that there is any difference between this and other cases. The motivation for such choices is still likely to be sexist, and any line to be drawn between 'acceptable' family balancing and unacceptable consumerism will be arbitrary and therefore unsustainable."
Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases,"One of the issues opponents are raising is the ethical and moral implication of breaking the law of nature, that is, the traditional way of conception without interfering with the gender of the unborn child. For them, parents should not act like “God” and deliberately choosing the sex of their baby."
Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide,"There is also the problem of son-preference: with greater sex selection technology, parents can abort a pregnancy if they know it is a female child."
Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide,"Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide."
Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide,"In September 2013, Archbishop Peter Smith, Vice-President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, decried the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to proceed against two doctors who accepted a request to perform an abortion as a means of sex selection, a procedure that is illegal in Britain and that Archbishop Smith described as one expression of what he called the injustice that abortion is to the unwanted child."
Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide,"Son preference refers to a cultural preference for sons over daughters, and manifests itself through practices such as sex selective abortion; female infanticide; or abandonment, neglect or abuse of girl-children."
Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide,"Under the tradition of son preference and the one-child policy, missing females in China are formed through sex-selective abortion, discrimination in care for females, and non-registration of girls at birth."
Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide,"Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son."
It is unethical/unhealthy for parents to intervene,"The very act of selecting our children creates a major ethical problem, and can only be justified when the aim is to avoid serious impairment. By choosing the characteristics of our children, we turn reproduction into just another consumer experience, and this degrades its profound existential significance. Because babies are human beings, not things, it is critical that much is left to chance in their process of coming into being."
It is unethical/unhealthy for parents to intervene,"Famed couples Chrissy Teigen and John Legend have openly credited PGD for their first-born's gender. Daughter Luna Simone was born in 2016 after the couple underwent IVF to get pregnant. The public backlash overwhelmed the couple. Teigen took to Twitter to defend the couple's position, I think I made a mistake in thinking people understood the process better than they do. Hard to explain such a complicated process here."
It is unethical/unhealthy for parents to intervene,Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have also been questioned about potentially selecting their children's genders during IVF treatments. The couple has adamantly denied the claims and refused to admit that they underwent the controversial testing and manipulation of the embryo before implantation for any of their three children.
It is unethical/unhealthy for parents to intervene,
It is unethical/unhealthy for parents to intervene,"Critics say that there is no assurance parents who have undergone a complicated process to conceive a child or children will remain happy with the decision they have made. If things will not work out the way they have hoped for, they might end up with rue and consider it a mistake. Opponents say that if conception was done the natural way, there will be lesser chances of regret."
It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child,Actual experience in Western cultures provides no evidence for any degree of gender imbalance from technologies which have long been available and legal - such as selective abortion or preimplantation embryo testing.
It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child,"Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family."
It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child,"Most families opt for unisex stuffs for babies before they are born. From clothes to toys, the color of the crib to the various necessities and accessories, everything is gender neutral in most cases. With gender selection or knowing baby’s gender can help every family to buy gender specific items. This not only does away with the ambiguity but actually helps the baby to get the best stuff as well. There is also a financial aspect as after the birthing of a baby, the parents always spend money on items that are for a boy or girl respectively. Knowing the gender or choosing gender allows for smart shopping during the trimesters. The economic advantage is not oft talked about but it is significant."
It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child,"Choosing baby’s gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isn’t always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby."
It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child,"The advantage selecting the gender of your baby in advance is that you are able plan for your family. This is because you will have just an adequate number of children raise. Consequently, you can be sure of giving them a good education and proper nutrition."
Sex selection allows for better family planning,"In an interview study, sex-selection technology providers generally argued that sex selection is an expression of reproductive rights, was initiated and pursued by women, and was a sign of female empowerment that allowed couples to make well-informed family planning decisions, prevented occurrences of unintended pregnancy and abortion, and minimized intimate partner violence and/or child neglect."
Sex selection allows for better family planning,"Perhaps one of the positive sides of applying the gender selection method is the opportunity of would-be parents to raise the number of children they want. In some countries, limiting the size of a family is encouraged. In fact, in China, there was a 1979 law which prohibited families to have more than one child although over the years, there had been some changes. Also, there are couples who want a specific gender for a first-born. With this practice now available, mothers need not have to give birth multiple times just so they can have a baby with the gender they prefer."
Sex selection allows for better family planning,"Another advantage of sex selection which proponents find important is the capacity of parents to start a family. With having just enough number of children to raise, couples will be more capable to take care of their kids and give them good education as well as proper nutrition."
Sex selection allows for better family planning,"Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name."
Sex selection allows for better family planning,"There are many couples who want a certain number of kids. Most couples want two kids and they want one girl and one boy. This is the most common family size that people opt for. But in an attempt to have one girl and one boy, a family may end up with three girls and one boy or one girl and two boys. Couples may keep trying for another baby if they want a girl or boy. Gender selection can help them to have the boy or girl they want and then restrict the family size as per their desire."
Sex selection allows for better family planning,"This is one of the positives of baby gender selection. This technology gives you an opportunity to raise the number of children they want. This is especially welcome where there is a limit to the family size. Most importantly, if you want a specific gender for your first-born you can achieve your goal. Overall, gender selection comes in handy where mothers no longer have to have many babies before they can have a baby of a gender they desire."
Sex selection prevents diseases in the child,Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex.
Sex selection prevents diseases in the child,Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases.
Sex selection prevents diseases in the child,"PGD can potentially be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, to have increased chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection."
Sex selection prevents diseases in the child,"One of the most valid evidences for gender selection is to limit the risk of transmitting hereditary, gender-specific diseases. Women who have a predisposition to genetic breast cancers are often faced with an 80% risk of getting the disease themselves, and a 50% risk of transmitting to daughters.  Many women can now be screened before getting pregnant to test for hereditary cancer-causing genes, with the help of Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD). But for those who truly unsettled at the idea of passing on a potentially deadly disease to their unborn children, gender selection can be a life-saver."
Sex selection prevents diseases in the child,"Some medical conditions are genetically related while others are gender specific and you can pass to your child. Where this is a concern, baby gender selection can be an effective way of preventing this condition."
Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide,"The immorality of prenatal sex selection has been questioned, with some arguments in favor of prenatal discrimination as more humane than postnatal discrimination by a family that does not want a female child."
Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide,"More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females."
Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide,"According to studies in western countries, the reasons why parents want to select the sex of their child centre around desiring a certain kind of parenting experience. For example, parents want a girl so that they can enjoy playing with dolls, shopping or dancing with their child. Or they want a son so they can play sport or go fishing together. There are mothers who want a daughter in order to have a close mother-daughter bond, or fathers who want a father-son bond. Their aim in “gender balancing” is not to have a variety of sex chromosomes or genitalia among their children, but to have a child who will live up to their gender assumptions."
Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide,"Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer."
Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide,"As it was, I went on to have three boys – I did try natural methods to have a girl but they didn't work – and when I got pregnant again, decided to have a private scan at 27 weeks to find out the baby’s sex. They were 98% positive it was a girl and I imagined my daughter, Zara. However I decided not to decorate the nursery pink just in case. And luckily I didn’t because my baby Zara turned out to be a boy, Adam. I was shocked but naturally absolutely adored him."
Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete,"In some regions of the world where son preference is especially strong, sonless women are treated as outcasts. In this way, sex-selective abortion is a way for women to select for male fetuses, helping secure greater family status."
Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete,"Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex."
Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete,"The study by researcher Darren Spedale found that 15 years after Denmark had granted same-sex couples the rights of marriage, rates of opposite-sex marriage in those countries had gone up, and rates of opposite-sex divorce had gone down - contradicting the concept that same-sex marriages would have a negative effect on opposite-sex marriages."
Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete,"For women who have found out the gender of their baby, and then went on to miscarry,  the possibility of having a healthy child of the same gender can be soothing. Of course, nothing can completely take away the pain of losing a child, but it can be small comfort to know that your lost child now has a brother or sister of the same gender to keep mom and dad company."
Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete,"For parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth, gender selection can be a very comforting option. "
Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete,"Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier."
flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique,"In common usage, the phrase 'flag burning' refers only to burning a flag as an act of protest."
flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique,"In December 1965, a group of five students, including lead plaintiff John Tinker and his sister Mary Beth Tinker, wore black armbands overlaid with a white peace sign between the dates of December 16 and New Years Day. The principals of the students' schools had previously threatened to suspend any students who participated in the protest. Despite the warning, the small group of students proceeded to carry out their dissent, and were duly suspended. ACLU attorneys representing the students argued that the armbands constituted a form of symbolic speech and, because their demonstration was suppressed, their First Amendment rights were unconstitutionally restrained. The court voted 7-2 in favor of Tinker, finding that the suspension had violated the First Amendment. Justice Fortas, delivering the opinion of the court, held the following:  In wearing armbands, the petitioners were quiet and passive. They were not disruptive, and did not impinge upon the rights of others. In these circumstances, their conduct was within the protection of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth."
flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique,"Symbolic action may overlap with symbolic speech, such as the use of flag burning to express hostility or saluting the flag to express patriotism."
flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique,"The US Court found under the First Amendment there was not a sufficient governmental interest to justify regulating this form of symbolic speech. Although not a flag burning case, this represented the first time the Court had clearly stated that protest involving the physical use of the flag should be seen as a form of protected expression under the First Amendment."
flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique,"However the United States Flag Code states that the flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display (for example, the flag being faded or torn), should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning."
flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique,"In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment."
flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique,"Miller's attorney held that symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment; burning a draft card is a most dramatic form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible."
flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression,"Judge White did not go so far as to say that flag-burning is not constitutionally protected; rather, he wrote that without the benefit of the majority's thinking if it were to find flag burning protected by the First Amendment, I would sustain such a conviction."
flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression,"In 1989, the Supreme Court handed down a controversial 5-4 decision in favor of Gregory Johnson, holding that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment."
flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression,"the Johnson majority found the lack of evidence for flag protection in the Constitution that necessitated the claim of uniqueness to counter indicate protection of the flag from free speech. They answered the uniqueness claim directly: We have not recognized an exception to [bedrock First Amendment principles] even where our flag has been involved... There is, moreover, no indication-either in the text of the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it-that a separate juridical category exists for the American flag alone..We decline, therefore, to create for the flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment"
flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression,"n 1990 O'Brien was analyzed again by critics following the case United States v. Eichman which determined that flag burning was a form of free speech, and some made comparisons to the earlier 1984 case Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence which determined that sleeping at a protest rally location in a downtown park was valid as a symbolic expression intended to bring attention to the plight of the homeless."
flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression,"Justice William Brennan, in his majority opinion asserted that the act of burning a flag was considered an expressive activity which is protected by the First Amendment."
flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression,Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression,"While flag desecration - like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures - is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable."
flag burning is an inflammatory act,"Rehnquist argued that flag burning is no essential part of any exposition of ideas but rather the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar that, it seems fair to say, is most likely to be indulged in not to express any particular idea, but to antagonize others"
flag burning is an inflammatory act,"In 2003,  Khalid led a protest march of several hundred people through Ras-Al Khaimah that culminated with Khalid himself burning the American flag and allowed the local radio station to broadcast a consistently anti-US line."
flag burning is an inflammatory act,1989 - Texas v. Johnson (491 U.S. 397) - The Supreme Court upheld the Texas Court of Criminal appeals finding that Texas law - making it a crime to desecrate or otherwise mistreat the flag in a way the actor knows will seriously offend one or more persons - was unconstitutional as applied.
flag burning is an inflammatory act,Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed.
flag burning is an inflammatory act,"While the proposed amendment is frequently referred to colloquially in terms of expression of political views through flag burning, the language would permit the prohibition of all forms of flag desecration, which may take forms other than burning, such as using the flag for clothing or napkins."
flag burning is an inflammatory act,"In 1990, the band received a bomb threat over its symbolic formation of a burning American Flag accompanied by The Doors' Light My Fire, a topical reference to the recent United States Supreme Court ruling upholding the right to flag burning and public debate about a possible Constitutional amendment to ban the act."

Flags are important symbols that should be respected,"The Street court did not consider whether a prohibition on burning the flag, without also prohibiting words against the flag, would be constitutional or unconstitutional. This question would remain open until 1989, when in Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, the Court invalidated a flag-burning statute."
Flags are important symbols that should be respected,Warren was of the opinion that laws against flag-burning are constitutional
Flags are important symbols that should be respected,"If so, then cases involving flag desecration would likely be restricted to the U.S. federal courts, as are cases involving criminal violations of copyright law."
Flags are important symbols that should be respected,Some countries have laws forbidding methods of destruction (such as burning in public) or forbidding particular uses (such as for commercial purposes); such laws may distinguish between desecration of the country's own national flag and flags of other countries.
Flags are important symbols that should be respected,"Gregory Lee 'Joey' Johnson (born 1956) is an American revolutionary Communist activist whose burning of the flag of the United States in a political demonstration during the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas, in violation of a Texas law prohibiting flag desecration, led to his role as defendant in the landmark United States Supreme Court case Texas v. Johnson (1989)."
Flags are important symbols that should be respected,"By 1932, all of the States had adopted flag desecration laws. In general, these State laws outlawed: (i) placing any kind of marking on the flag, whether for commercial, political, or other purposes; (ii) using the flag in any form of advertising; and (iii) publicly mutilating, trampling, defacing, defiling, defying or casting contempt, either by words or by act, upon the flag."
Flags are important symbols that should be respected,"Rehnquist wrote: The American flag, then, throughout more than 200 years of our history, has come to be the visible symbol embodying our Nation. It does not represent the views of any particular political party, and it does not represent any particular political philosophy. The flag is not simply another idea or point of view competing for recognition in the marketplace of ideas. Millions and millions of Americans regard it with an almost mystical reverence regardless of what sort of social, political, or philosophical beliefs they may have. I cannot agree that the First Amendment invalidates the Act of Congress, and the laws of 48 of the 50 States, which make criminal the public burning of the flag."
Flags are important symbols that should be respected,"For example, Hugo Black did not believe that flag burning was speech; in Street v. New York (1969), he wrote: It passes my belief that anything in the Federal Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning of the American flag an offense."

Flags are important symbols that should be respected,"Chief Justice Warren wrote that while the First Amendment does protect freedom of speech, it does not protect all things that may extraneously be labeled 'symbolic speech"
Flags are important symbols that should be respected,In Austria flag desecration is illegal under Â§248 Strafgesetzbuch.
Flags are important symbols that should be respected,"The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period."
Flags are important symbols that should be respected,"Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?"
Flags are important symbols that should be respected,"It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men."
Flags are important symbols that should be respected,Women are physically smaller than men and lack the same potential to achieve ultimate physical fitness. This view is supported by the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine.
Flags are important symbols that should be respected,As a distinguished American general recently said: soldiers can be pack animals or warriors; they just can’t be both at the same time.
There should be equality between men and women.,Gender equality helps prevent violence against women and girls and makes our communities safer and healthier. It is a human right and it is good for the economy.
There should be equality between men and women.,"Women’s impact doesn’t stop with individual companies and organizations. Studies show that increasing women’s participation in the economy is good for the economy. In OECD countries, if the female employment rates were raised to match Sweden, it would lead to a GDP increase equivalent to $6 trillion. Gender pay gaps end up costing the economy."
There should be equality between men and women.,"The principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work has been enshrined in the European Treaties since 1957 (today: Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)). Article 153 TFEU allows the EU to act in the wider area of equal opportunities and equal treatment in employment matters and within this framework Article 157 TFEU authorises positive action to empower women. In addition, Article 19 TFEU provides for the adoption of legislation to combat all forms of discrimination, including on the basis of sex. Legislation against trafficking in human beings, in particular women and children, has been adopted on the basis of Articles 79 and 83 TFEU. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme finances, among others, measures contributing to the eradication of violence against women, based on Article 168 TFEU."
There should be equality between men and women.,We need gender equality urgently. Gender equality prevents violence against women and girls. It’s essential for economic prosperity. Societies that value women and men as equal are safer and healthier. Gender equality is a human right. Everyone benefits from gender equality.
There should be equality between men and women.,"When it comes to family life, the sense is that men and women have about the same influence in making important decisions in their households. A 34-country median of 55% say both have roughly equal influence when it comes to important decisions about household finances, 56% say this about how to raise children and 62% say this of decisions about a family’s religious practices. To the extent that people see a difference, however, men are generally seen as having more of an influence than women when it comes to decisions about household finances, while women are generally seen as having more influence when it comes to decisions about raising children."
There should be equality between men and women.,"Twenty-five years after the United Nations’ Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action pledged to take the necessary steps to “remove all obstacles to gender equality and the advancement and empowerment of women,” support for gender equality is strong around the globe. Across 34 countries surveyed by Pew Research Center, a median of 94% think it is important for women in their country to have the same rights as men, with 74% saying this is very important."
There should be equality between men and women.,"In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home."
Women are an asset in combat,"In fact, there are certain combat positions for which women provide a unique tactical advantage in counterinsurgency operations. Male service members, for example, are prohibited from looking at or speaking to Afghan women on patrols and from touching them at routine checkpoints to search for weapons and explosives—a challenge that poses a security risk that only female service members are equipped to address. "
Women are an asset in combat,"Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat. "
Women are an asset in combat,"As a health professional and a researcher, Mar Nagel found that women often excel in cognitive and strategic decisions. They have better social and communication skills than men, possess strong memory, are sophisticated and show precision and fast reaction and response time."
Women are an asset in combat,"Equal or Better Performance at Military Service Academies: Women have been admitted to the Army, Navy and Air Force Academies since 1978. In this year’s first graduating classes with women, the women’s performance has equaled and often surpassed that of their male counterparts."
Women are an asset in combat,"Fewer Disciplinary Problems: The average woman recruit is much less likely than a male recruit to become a discipline problem. Women lose far less time than men for absence without leave, desertion, alcoholism and drug abuse."
Women are an asset in combat,"that warfare is changing and becoming so high-tech that hand-to-hand combat is rare, making physical strength less important; and that women who qualify for combat posts can beat back the enemy with great skill."
Women are an asset in combat,"A study on UK soldiers who fought in Iraq in 2006 showed a lack of gender differences in veterans who had post-traumatic stress disorder. This suggests that combat doesn’t pose a higher risk to women’s mental health than it does to men’s. In fact, psychological research has shown that female soldiers in combat may be more resilient to its effects than male soldiers. Women don’t need to be “protected” from the difficulties of combat units – they can take the heat."
Women can create unique skills/strategies,"In fact, there are certain combat positions for which women provide a unique tactical advantage in counterinsurgency operations. Male service members, for example, are prohibited from looking at or speaking to Afghan women on patrols and from touching them at routine checkpoints to search for weapons and explosives—a challenge that poses a security risk that only female service members are equipped to address. "
Women can create unique skills/strategies,"Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal. "
Women can create unique skills/strategies,"Perhaps the first instance of organized women’s soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat."
Women can create unique skills/strategies,"The more complete integration of women into men's units will make the military a more effective force by introducing more diverse viewpoints. Being able to tackle problems from many perspectives can be useful to the military's mission in a rapidly changing world. In Iraq, female troops have proven useful at gaining the trust of Iraqi women and children, an area in which male soldiers have failed."
Women can create unique skills/strategies,"Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength."
Women can create unique skills/strategies,It was during the Crimean War (1853-1856) that Florence Nightingale and her team of female nurses revolutionised the care of injured combatants. Her spartan field hospital was located uncomfortably close to the frontline. British nurses endured terrible conditions and were exposed to a multitude of dangers.
Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat,"According to Nindl, et al. (p. 51, 2016), training programs increased the number of pull-ups that women were capable of, demonstrating that they could overcome their naturally smaller muscle mass. Additionally, their research found that women performed better than men in ultra-endurance, or the ability to physical endure for a given extended period of time. These studies suggest that women excel in some abilities, and that while men are indeed stronger as a physical typicality, there are exceptions and other ways that women can compete. "
Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat,"Advocates of gender integration say women are fully capable of performing the difficult and sometimes brutal tasks involved with combat, and they point out that even though women have been barred officially from combat duties in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers have nonetheless fought and died there."
Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat,"In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw. "
Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat,"Likewise, during World War II, the Soviet Union formed three all-female and mixed-gender air regiments. They operated continuously between 1942 and 1945, allowing for comparison with other Soviet air units. Overall, the three regiments flew about 30,000 sorties and two of the three were granted the elite “guards” designation. Two of the pilots were recognized as “aces” and 31 airwomen decorated as “heroes of the Soviet Union."
Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat,"From the Revolutionary War to present day conflicts, women have proudly served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard as nurses, pilots, engineers, soldiers and other specialties. During World War I, about 35,000 women officially served as nurses and support staff. During World War II, 140,000 women served in the U.S. Army and the Women's Army Corps (WAC) performing critical jobs such as military intelligence, cryptography and parachute rigging. Over 1,000 women flew aircraft for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)."
Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to,"To be frank, the arguments for keeping women from fighting in combat are sexist and stupid. The idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying, and the argument that women are too weak to fight has been proven false by female athlete after female athlete, not to mention by the women already serving in the army."
Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to,"In the field, you don’t care whether the soldier next to you is male or female—all you care about is whether they will get the job done and save you and your platoon a weekend’s worth of extra duty."
Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to,"For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units."
Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to,A 2010 British Ministry of Defense study concluded that women performed the same as men.
Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to,Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly.
Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests,"As long as they qualify and meet the standards, women will now be able to contribute to our mission in ways they could not before. They'll be able to drive tanks, give orders, lead infantry soldiers into combat, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said at a news conference Thursday (Dec. 3)."
Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests,"Joni Ernst, Republican senator from Iowa and an Army veteran, also backs the measure. Ernst said a draft is very unlikely, and the all-volunteer force is preferable, but women would be essential in any future conflict. Ernst said a woman wouldn’t necessarily be fighting on the frontlines. She could choose to serve in the infantry if she met the standard, Ernst said. “She could also serve in a cyber unit, where she is sitting behind the lines where she's safe, but certainly working to disrupt the enemy. All of these jobs are important.”"
Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests,"Many have argued that there are biological differences that limit the physical capacity of women. Even if there is some evidence to these claims, which are often exaggerated, women have rights, one of which is to be assessed as individuals. Even if 99 percent of women do not meet military fitness standards, the 1percent who do should be allowed to use their abilities to serve their country."
Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests,"While fewer women might achieve such levels, as Jon Soltz, notes: There are women who can meet these standards, and they have a right to compete."
Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests,"The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019.

Men are better suited to combat roles than women," A yearlong Marine Corps study found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units of men and women. Sources claim that the military is easing fitness standards because the female soldiers can’t meet them; lowering such standards hurts the institution as a whole."
Men are better suited to combat roles than women,Physical differences may still be a hindrance to women serving in combat units.
Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers,"The physical differences between men and women are obvious, as few women have the strength, speed, or aerobic capacity of even the average man. The British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units."
Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers,"Although women have been involved in combat skirmishes, ground-combat service requires sustained combat, sometimes over the course of days or weeks, often under loads substantially exceeding that of the soldier of World War II. This is a disastrous decision made by people (a re-elected president and an outgoing secretary of defense) who will not have to bear its consequences. Instead theywill be suffered by the soldier on the ground, and in some cases they are likely to be fatal."
Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers,"In an interview with CNN on January 4, Maj. General Robert Dees, the campaign chair for Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, said he didn’t think it was a good idea: “If you look at the population demographics, most women…cannot properly carry a 230-pound soldier—with a rucksack and combat vest on—off of the battlefield to save his life. "
Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers,"While the majority of jobs in the armed forces are open equally to men and women, there are some to which women are just not physically suited. The standards of physical fitness have been set to suit men, and women attempting to reach them will over-stretch themselves.  In addition, combat units engage in activities designed to suit men’s capabilities. Women serving in integrated units will suffer higher injury rates as a result of this."
Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers,"More than seven months after the official launch of the Army Combat Fitness Test, or ACFT, nearly half of female soldiers are still falling short, with enlisted women struggling the most, Military.com has learned. The data again raises questions about whether the Army's attempt to create a fitter force is creating more barriers to success for women."
Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers,The US Army is considering reversing gender neutral physical tests because women are overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. The results showed that an overwhelming majority of the women failed to clear the tests while almost 90% of the men managed to pass them.
Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military,Having women serving in direct combat will hamper mission effectiveness by hurting unit morale and cohesion.
Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military,"Presidential candidate Rick Santorum voiced their concerns last week when he said that women serving on the front line could prove a distraction to men. Men have emotions when [they] see a woman in harm’s way, he said. It’s natural. It’s very much in our culture to be protective."
Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military,"While it may be a feel-good move for many progressives, the end result might well be to lower the standards for all troops and damage the quality of the military."
Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military,"Lower female standards also reinforce the belief that women cannot perform the same job as men, therefore making it difficult for women to earn the trust and confidence of their teammates."
Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military,"Inconvenient truth is that men and women have been each other’s most consistent distraction since the beginning of time. To pretend that we don’t know what will happen when men and women are thrown together for prolonged periods in emotionally intense situations defies common sense. Being overly academic and insufficiently adult about adult behavior isn’t just irresponsible but imperiling, and belies the deadly seriousness with which we should want combat units to perform."
Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military," When men and women are posted to the same unit for extended overseas tours they will naturally form attachments. There may be instances of fraternisation where male and female soldiers have sexual relations with multiple partners within the same chain of command. These may include extra-marital affairs that undermine longstanding relationships with partners back home. In some instances, such episodes may degrade unit cohesion, foster petty rivalries, incite jealousy or feelings of resentment. They can impact unit morale, undermine teamwork and risk reducing operational effectiveness."
Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military,"However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today."
Women should serve in safer roles," In the Second World War, British Government records show that 640,000 women served in non-combat roles. Even Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II trained as a mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Female roles included pilots, ambulance drivers, clerks, mechanics and nurses. Again, many thousands paid the ultimate price for their service."
Women should serve in safer roles,"Researchers have identified a dominant “warrior culture” among many male soldiers in the Canadian armed forces, especially those in combat arms. Adherence to this way of thinking equates women with weakness, an excess of emotion and the need to be protected. "
Women should serve in safer roles,"1988 – The DoD convenes its Task Force on Women in the Military and adopts the “risk rule,” which excludes women from combat units or missions which risk exposure to direct combat, hostile fire, or capture."
Women should serve in safer roles,"The idea that women give birth and have a naturally nurturing disposition, or – more practically – that the death of a woman in battle could leave young children motherless."
Women should serve in safer roles," In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support."
Women soldier capture is a big concern,It is a certainty. History shows it. Every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Even the female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg.
Women soldier capture is a big concern,"During the 1991 Gulf War, there were two American female POWs: an Army Flight Surgeon, Major Rhonda Cornum, and an Army Transportation Specialist, Melissa Rathbun-Nealy. Cornum was subjected to sexual indecencies within hours of her capture. (She was released eight days later, but said nothing in public about the sexual assault for more than a year.)"
Women soldier capture is a big concern," Female prisoners of war (POW) have likewise been taken during most major United States conflicts. Even so-called “noncombatants,” such as nurses, water couriers, and messengers have risked death or maiming every time they stepped onto the battlefield because smoke, dust, blood, and noise often precluded easy identification of friends or foes. Especially in later conflicts, “fluid” battle lines have engulfed support personnel, including women, placing them in the direct line of fire."
Women soldier capture is a big concern,"In 1861, 29-year-old Dr. Mary Walker applied to become a surgeon with the Union Army, as she had been one of the few female physicians in the country prior to the start of the Civil War. She was rejected but remained on as a volunteer, leveraging her skills to treat the wounded, AUSA noted. Two years later, Walker finally received an appointment to serve an assistant surgeon in the Army, after spending additional time as a field surgeon in Virginia, according to an Army story. In the latter years of the war, Walker was captured by Confederate forces, held in squalid conditions as a prisoner of war, yet another in a long line of abuses due to her status as a woman."
Women soldier capture is a big concern,"Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough."

It is preferable to spend the money elsewhere,"Journalism is not suffering as much as traditional media companies are. Yes, the massive job cuts in newsrooms are disturbing. But we also are seeing an energetic response from entrepreneurs and philanthropists that is producing a stunning array of new journalism organizations. Anyone who can’t see potential in enterprises such as Politico, ProPublica, West Seattle Blog, MinnPost and The Batavian is deliberately uninformed and should not be taken seriously."
It is preferable to spend the money elsewhere,"Postal subsidies from our nation’s early founding (cited as a precedent by Downie/Schudson and McChesney/Nichols) are irrelevant.

The feds already bailed out undeserving banks and automobile manufacturers and are trying to figure out how to fix our health-care system. The taxpayers can’t afford to bail out undeserving media companies and journalism can’t afford to be dependent on a debt-burdened government.

Space exploration can be carried by the private sector,"paceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic — achieved key feats in space travel previously reserved to countries. They transported astronauts to the International Space Station, flew space enthusiasts into space, delivered cargo to low Earth orbit and developed reusable booster rockets."
Space exploration can be carried by the private sector,"Musk’s SpaceX in particular has demonstrated the commercial ventures can be successful and help bolster NASA. For years SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies for the space agency to the ISS. NASA has expanded that public-private partnership, allowing SpaceX to fly its most precious resources—its astronauts—to the space station as well. The company also recently won a $3 billion contract to develop the spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the surface of the moon."
Space exploration can be carried by the private sector,"After investing billions of dollars into the ISS, NASA cannot afford to build another space station in Earth orbit, especially as it is embarking on an effort to return humans to the moon, under a program called Artemis. Instead, it is looking to the private sector to develop next-generation habitats that would be owned and operated by the companies, not NASA. The space agency has recently taken the first major steps in that direction, reaching an agreement with Axiom Space, a Houston-based company that has hired Starck, to send a module of its space station to attach to the ISS as a test bed as soon as 2024. Late last year, NASA awarded contracts to develop commercial space stations, worth $415.6 million combined, to Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, Nanoracks, which helps companies fly science experiments and other payloads to the ISS, and Northrop Grumman, the longtime defense contractor."
Space exploration can be carried by the private sector,"One-third of Americans think national government agencies, such as NASA, should solely be responsible for sending astronauts to the moon, the International Space Station, or Mars (37% in all three cases). A similar number instead believe national governments and private companies should share the duty of sending humans to the ISS (35%), the moon (35%), or Mars (33%). "
Space exploration can be carried by the private sector,"In recent years, NASA has teamed up with private, for-profit rocket companies to transport humans to outer space. Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate."
Space exploration is expensive,"After all is said and done about what went wrong, the bottom line is simple: money. It's about $10,000 to put a pound of anything into a near-earth orbit. (Imagine John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, made of solid gold, and you can appreciate the enormous cost of space travel.) It costs $500 to $700 million every time the shuttle flies. Billionaire space tourists have flown to the space station at a reputed price of $20 million per head."
Space exploration is expensive,"So long as we rely on chemical propulsion to lift us into orbit, space travel will never be cheap. The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still."
Space exploration is expensive,"Rockets and spaceflight instruments do not assemble themselves. They are designed and built by people, who get paid. They are fabricated from components which have to be manufactured and then purchased. The community engaged in the space industry includes specialist scientists and engineers, designers, graphic artists and IT professionals, as well as a vast support system: HR, catering, cleaning, etc."
Space exploration is expensive,These space programs and agencies are very costly. It is estimated that the total annual budget of space agencies is $41.8 billion.
Space exploration is expensive,"The money being spent on space exploration cost the billions and it has done a lot of advanced technology which would possibly have come anyway by other means. Space exploration is costly, difficult ,harsh ,perilous and risky."
Space exploration is ineffective,Bill Nye explains why space exploration is a waste of time.
Space exploration is ineffective,"The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely. "
Space exploration is ineffective,"Back in early 1970, shortly after the first Apollo landing, a nun working in Zambia, Africa, Sister Mary Jucunda, wrote to NASA. She asked how they could justify spending billions on the Apollo program when children were starving to death."
Space exploration is ineffective,"Satellite technology has of course had a beneficial effect on our world. However, there is a huge difference between launching satellites into Earth orbit, and exploring space. Missions to other planets, and into interstellar space, do not contribute to life on our planet. Moreover, satellites are largely commercial - they are launched by private companies, and are maintained by the profits which they lead to. True space exploration could never be commercial, and requires huge government subsidies - the Voyager missions alone cost just under $1 billion. This money could be much better spent elsewhere."
Space exploration is ineffective,"Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, “The SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.” Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the world’s recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?"
There are issues more important to fund than space exploration,"Space exploration is not necessarily something that we need right now. However, poverty is a contemporary issue.  In fact, according to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty."
There are issues more important to fund than space exploration,"Robin Hanbury-Tention assume that the concept that we ought is to only spend money on necessary issues which can be like development as a civilization: if we had been to address things in this manner all the time, we might continually find something else extra worth of expenditure, and by no means definitely solve something properly. We’re an smart species, so absolutely we can address multiple difficulty at a time. Space research a gross waste of money and time and effort that will better if they applied it on our planet rather than the space "
There are issues more important to fund than space exploration,"Space exploration is a waste of resources and its dangerous to , so may accident and problems happened in the space like shattering of space vehicles , explosions, pieces falling off and missing the gravity of earth , that is even waste more money to fix them."
There are issues more important to fund than space exploration,"Even if there are benefits to space exploration, spending so much money and effort in reaching other planets is highly questionable. That money and brain power could be used to solve other more important problems for us. For instance governments could invest much more to prevent global warming, reduce crime rates and find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's Disease."
There are issues more important to fund than space exploration,"There are a number of ways to spend a $19.3 billion annual budget; we could pay for 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, we could provide 1.87 million people with health care, or we could use the money to fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for one year."
Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets,"Space colonies can supply clean energy necessary for human survival in the 21st century. In addition, they can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for our species."
Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets,"Ultimately, space colonies could be built anywhere in the solar system. By increasing the size of the mirrors used to direct sunlight into the living and agricultural sections, it would be possible to support habitats beyond the orbit of Pluto if we so desire. Given the known resources of the asteroids, there is sufficient material to construct habitats capable of supporting populations thousands of times larger than that of Earth. By increasing our ecological niche to include the solar system, the human species would become much less likely to be destroyed by a single natural or made-man catastrophe."
Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets,"The most common ideas for space colonization include: settling Earth’s Moon, building on Mars, and constructing free-floating space stations."
Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets,"Space exploration isn’t simply a sign of humanity’s hubris or a brazen desire to find new places to live and new sources of wealth. If we take the risk of venturing beyond our terrestrial home, it’s also to learn more about ourselves and our planet, improve life on Earth, and maybe, just maybe, find or create a new future for our children, says Walter Cugno, Vice President Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space. "
Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets,"It’s time to ask ourselves the big question: Should we try to colonize our solar system, or not? I’ll readily admit I’m for it, and I suspect a large portion of the space community would stand with me – but this isn’t the space community’s decision, or in fact, any single nation’s decision. A broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties will be essential to an undertaking of this magnitude and complexity. "
Space exploration improves science/technology,"As a stimulant and catalyst for the development of new technologies, and for research in the basic sciences, it is unparalleled by any other activity. In this respect, we may even say that the space program is taking over a function which for three or four thousand years has been the sad prerogative of wars."
Space exploration improves science/technology,"Very fortunately though, the space age not only holds out a mirror in which we can see ourselves, it also provides us with the technologies, the challenge, the motivation, and even with the optimism to attack these tasks with confidence. "
Space exploration improves science/technology,"An artist’s concept of New Horizons during the spacecraft’s planned encounter with Pluto and its moon Charon. The craft’s miniature cameras, radio science experiment, ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers, and space plasma experiments would characterize the global geology and geomorphology of Pluto and Charon, map their surface compositions and temperatures, and examine Pluto’s atmosphere in detail."
Space exploration improves science/technology,"Satellite imagery and climate data also supports sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. Amazon Web Services and Digital Earth Africa use Open Data Cube to make global satellite data more accessible and can be used to help farmers improve food production to reduce hunger, tackle unregulated mining and its knock-on effects, and identify new opportunities for economic growth."
Space exploration improves science/technology,"After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science."
Space exploration is financially beneficial,"Dollars spent for space exploration create jobs, jumpstart businesses, and grow the economy. Our innovations improve daily life, advance medical research, support disaster response, and more. We're constantly evolving and finding new ways to add value."
Space exploration is financially beneficial,"Many countries around the world invest in space science and exploration as a balanced part of their total federal budget. Public opinion research has shown that people estimate NASA to take up as much as a quarter of the U.S. federal budget, but in fact, NASA’s budget only represents about 0.5% of the total federal budget and the proportion is even smaller for other spacefaring nations."
Space exploration is financially beneficial,"The United States government spent approximately $6.6 trillion in fiscal year 2020, of which just 0.3% ($22.6 billion) was provided to NASA. In this chart, shades of blue represent mandatory spending programs; shades of orange are discretionary programs that require annual appropriations by Congress. Defense and related includes both the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs."
Space exploration is financially beneficial,"Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access."
Space exploration is financially beneficial,"Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video."
Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity,"Every year, about a thousand technical innovations generated in the space program find their ways into our earthly technology where they lead to better kitchen appliances and farm equipment, better sewing machines and radios, better ships and airplanes, better weather forecasting and storm warning, better communications, better medical instruments, better utensils and tools for everyday life."
Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity,Space Exploration for the Survival of the Human Race
Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity,
Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity,"Spaceflight isn’t just a master-minded escape plan for the richest among us, though. The key to saving our planet, and humanity, partly relies on the innovations from space exploration. The commercial sector has already adopted inventions that were funded or designed by space agencies. These include several ecology-based projects like one that uses LED light color that triggers growth for indoor agriculture or satellites used to predict the weather and document climate change. Space technologies are evolving and can help us harness a more sustainable world."
Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity,Scientists use the data from these next-generation satellites – which take measurements every 85 centimeters along the ground path – to hopefully improve forecasts for rising sea levels and global weather and climate patterns.
Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity,"Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions.

School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning,"In 2018, the Schoolwear Assiciation conducted a series of focus groups with pupils from Year 7 and Year 9 to get the inside views on uniforms. We found that many pupils chose to remain in their uniform outside of school to complete homework. Most children explained that it helped them stay focussed while they worked, keeping them in the ‘school mindset’. While non-uniform days may be exciting, our research found that pupils viewed them as ‘non-work’ days, and teachers reported a drop in behavior standards as a result."

School uniforms saves costs,"According to recent NY Post article, most parents responded that they spent $48 on pants for their children and that $30 was a reasonable price for a T-shirt. Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs."

School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity,"B.R. international Public School shows that alongside featuring unity, uniforms likewise promote equality. Envision the circumstance without school uniforms. Students would show up in garments of their decision. Regardless of the amount we attempt, this will ingrain inequality- kids from rich foundations would wear their marked garments and adornments, while other students would build up a feeling of inadequacy. "
School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity,"Uniforms not only unify students’ appearances, but they also create a sense of unity in terms of community. A student in a uniform feels they belong to their school and that their school belongs to them. They boost school pride and spirit."

School uniform is harming the student's self expression,"To some extent, it runs counter to the freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment (“School dress codes,” 2017)."
School uniform is harming the student's self expression,"Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, told NBC News' Today show: 'As a body image expert, I hear from students all the time that they feel it (wearing uniforms) allows for a lot of comparison. ... So if you have a body that’s a plus-size body, a curvier body, a very tall body, a very short body, those girls often feel that they don't look their best.' "

School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist,"For example, many types of clothes popular among female students (especially during hot weather) are considered to be “sexually suggestive” (“School dress codes,” 2017, para. 7). According to the proponents of such rules for teenage girls, short skirts and similar clothes contribute to sexual crime in schools (“School dress codes,” 2017)."

School uniform harms learning/creativity,"The people who make up the rules for uniform requirement have false beliefs that the student body will be better because it has to look the same. That sounds more like a post-apocalyptic society in which we are all forced to think the same and have no choices in our lives from the day we are born, similar to novels such as Anthem and Fahrenheit 451. "
School uniform harms learning/creativity,"As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression."
School uniform harms learning/creativity,"Brunsma writes in The School Uniform Movement and What It Tells Us About American Education, that uniform policies don't curb violence or behavioral problems in schools. They don't cultivate student self-esteem and motivation. They don't balance the social-status differences that often separate students. And they don't improve academic achievement. "

School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality,Uniforms could delay an adolescent's transition into adulthood. A quote states that “Adults make their own clothing choices and have the freedom to express themselves through their appearance.
School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality,"Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices."
Gun control is ineffective,Criminals overwhelmingly obtain their firearms through illegal channels and will never be deterred by state and federal laws.

Gun control is ineffective,A study in Applied Economics Letters found that “assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level” and “states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders.”
Gun control is ineffective,"Banning high-capacity magazines will not necessarily deter crime because even small gun magazines can be changed in seconds.The “gun show loophole” is virtually nonexistent because commercial dealers, who sell the majority of guns at shows and elsewhere, are bound by strict federal laws. "
Gun control is ineffective,"According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates."

Gun ownership is a right,"The U.S. Supreme Court revisited the issue in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, 478 F.3d 370. The plaintiff in Heller challenged the constitutionality of a Washington D.C. law which prohibited the possession of handguns. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down the D.C. handgun ban as violative of that right. The Court meticulously detailed the history and tradition of the Second Amendment at the time of the Constitutional Convention and proclaimed that the Second Amendment established an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms."
Gun ownership is a right,"In 2010, the Court further strengthened Second Amendment protections in McDonald v. City of Chicago, 567 F.3d 856. The plaintiff in McDonald challenged the constitutionality of the Chicago handgun ban, which prohibited handgun possession by almost all private citizens. In a 5-4 decision, the Court, citing the intentions of the framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment, held that the Second Amendment applies to the states through the incorporation doctrine."
Gun ownership is a right,"In 2022, the Supreme Court further expanded upon the precedent set by Heller in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. In Bruen, the Court struck down a New York law requiring parties interested in purchasing a handgun for the use of self-defense outside of the home to obtain a license because the law issued licenses on a “may-issue” rather than a “shall issue” basis. This “may issue” licensing method allowed state authorities to deny interested parties public use licenses for firearms if the interested party was unable to show “proper cause” as to why they have a heightened need for self-protection over the general population. "
Gun ownership is a right,"In a 5-4 vote Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court declared for the first time that the Second Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the right of individual Americans to keep and bear arms. The court said gun ownership is an individual right, not connected with military service, and that it can be regulated in some ways."

Gun ownership promotes self protection,"Journalist John Stossel explained, “Criminals don’t obey the law… Without the fear of retaliation from victims who might be packing heat, criminals in possession of these [illegal] weapons now have a much easier job… As the saying goes, ‘If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.'” "
Gun ownership promotes self protection,"Daniel J. Schultz, lawyer, stated, “the Framers [of the Constitution and Bill of Rights] understood that ‘well-regulated’ militias, that is, armed citizens, ready to form militias that would be well trained, self-regulated and disciplined would post no threat to their fellow citizens, but would, indeed, help to ‘insure domestic Tranquility’ and ‘provide for the common defence.'"
Gun ownership promotes self protection,"Marco Rubio (R-FL), US Senator, speaking about gun control laws during his 2016 presidential campaign, stated, 'If God forbid, ISIS visits our life, our neighborhood, our school, any part of us, the last thing standing, the last line of defense could very well be our ability to protect ourselves.'"
Gun ownership promotes self protection,"Constitutions in 37 US states protect the right to bear arms for self-defense, most with explicit language such as Alabama’s: 'every citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of himself and the state.'"
Gun ownership promotes self protection,"Wayne LaPierre, Executive Vice President of the NRA, stated, 'The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.'"
Gun ownership promotes self protection,"A May 9, 2013 48% of convicted felons surveyed admitted that they avoided committing crimes when they knew the victim was armed with a gun. "
Gun ownership promotes self protection,Pew Foundation report found that 79% of male gun owners and 80% of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer and 64% of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer.
Gun ownership promotes self protection,"Even Senator Dianne Feinstein, a gun control advocate, carried a concealed gun when her life was threatened and her home attacked by the New World Liberation Front in the 1970s. "
Gun ownership promotes self protection,"In a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, gun owners were most likely to cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. Roughly six-in-ten (63%) said this in an open-ended question. "
Banning guns would save lives,Guns were the leading cause of death by homicide (67.7% of all homicides) and by suicide (51.8% of all suicides).
Banning guns would save lives,"A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that firearms were the second leading cause of deaths for children, responsible for 15% of child deaths compared to 20% in motor vehicle crashes. "
Banning guns would save lives,A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that “legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death”
Banning guns would save lives,"Between 1999 and 2013 there were 270,237 firearm suicides in the United States, accounting for about 52% of all suicides during those years."
Banning guns would save lives,"Harvard professor David Hemenway, PhD, wrote 'We analyzed the relationship between homicide and gun availability using data from 26 developed countries from the early 1990s. We found that across developed countries, where guns are more available, there are more homicides.'"
Banning guns would save lives,"When US gun ownership goes down, overall suicide rates drop; meanwhile, each 10 percentage-point increase in gun ownership is linked to a 26.9% increase in the youth suicide rate."
Banning guns would save lives, Female first-time firearm owners were 35 times more likely to commit suicide within 12 years of buying the gun compared to women who did not own guns; male first-time firearm owners were about eight times more likely to do so.
Banning guns would save lives,"In 2015, assaults with a firearm were 6.8 times more common in states that had the most guns, compared to the leas."
Banning guns would save lives,"More than a dozen studies have revealed that if you had a gun at home, you were twice as likely to be killed as someone who didn’t."
Banning guns would save lives,Research from the Harvard School of Public Health tells us that states with higher gun ownership levels have higher rates of homicide.
Banning guns would save lives,"Data even tells us that where gun shops or gun dealers open for business, killings go up. "
Banning guns would save lives,"When Missouri repealed its permit law, gun-related killings increased by 25 percent."
Guns can fall into the wrong hands,A June 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report states that 'Almost all guns used in criminal acts enter circulation via initial legal transaction.'
Guns can fall into the wrong hands,"Between 2005 and 2010, 1.4 million guns were stolen from US homes during property crimes (including burglary and car theft), a yearly average of 232,400."
Guns can fall into the wrong hands,"Ian Ayres, JD, PhD, and John J. Donohue, JD, PhD, Professors of Law at Yale Law School and Stanford Law School respectively, state, “with guns being a product that can be easily carried away and quickly sold at a relatively high fraction of the initial cost, the presence of more guns can actually serve as a stimulus to burglary and theft. "
Guns can fall into the wrong hands,A Secret Service analysis found that of 24 mass shootings in 2019 at least 10 (42%) involved illegally possessed guns.
Guns can fall into the wrong hands,"John R. Lott, Jr., PhD, gun rights activist, stated, “The problem with such [gun control] laws is that they take away guns from law-abiding citizens, while would-be criminals ignore them.”"
Guns can fall into the wrong hands,"According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics May 2013 report, 37.4% of state prison inmates who “used, carried, or possessed a firearm when they committed the crime for which they were serving a prison sentence” obtained the gun from a family member or friend. "
Guns can fall into the wrong hands,"'Guns do fall into the wrong hands,' Commissioner Ramsey said, adding that many guns used by criminals were originally purchased legally."
Guns can fall into the wrong hands,"One of the worst recent examples was the massacre in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church last November, in which 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns."
Guns lead to accidental deaths,"According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance, states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths and “89% of unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home—and most of these deaths occur when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents’ absence.”"
Guns lead to accidental deaths, The US General Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that 31% of total accidental shooting deaths could have been prevented by installing safety devices on guns: 100% of deaths per year in which a child under 6 years old shoots and kills him/herself or another child could be prevented by automatic child-proof safety locks; and 23% of accidental shooting deaths by adolescents and adults per year could be prevented by loading indicators showing when a bullet was in the chamber ready to be fired.
Guns lead to accidental deaths," Marjorie Sanfilippo, PhD, Professor of Psychology at Eckerd College who has researched children’s behavior around guns, stated, “We put gates around swimming pools to keep children from drowning. We put safety caps on medications to keep children from poisoning themselves. Because children are naturally curious and impulsive, and because we have shown time and again that we cannot ‘gun-proof’ them with education, we have a responsibility to keep guns out of the hands of children.”"
Guns lead to accidental deaths,"Jim Barrett, author for TheTruthAboutGuns.com, stated, 'the theory that the restriction or elimination of guns would have a positive effect on the overall suicide rate in the U.S. does not hold up under scrutiny.'"
Guns lead to accidental deaths,"Accidental gun deaths occur mainly to those under 25 years old. So far in 2022, 209 children (age 0-17) have died by gunshot and an additional 519 were injured. Adolescents are particularly susceptible to accidental shootings due to specific behavioral characteristics associated with adolescence, such as impulsivity, feelings of invincibility, and curiosity about firearms."
Guns lead to accidental deaths,"In 2021, unintentional shooting deaths accounted for over 4% (2,007) of total gun related deaths (44,912) in the United States. "
Guns lead to accidental deaths,A study from 2014 showed that victims of unintentional shootings were three times more likely to live in a household with a firearm.
Guns lead to accidental deaths,"A 2001 study found that regardless of age, people are nine times more likely to die from unintentional firearm injuries when they live in states with more guns, relative to states with fewer guns."
Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence,"Jeffrey Voccola, Assistant Professor of Writing at Kutztown University, notes, 'The average gun owner, no matter how responsible, is not trained in law enforcement or on how to handle life-threatening situations, so in most cases, if a threat occurs, increasing the number of guns only creates a more volatile and dangerous situation.'"
Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence,"The FBI found that in 2013 arguments (such as romantic triangles, brawls fueled by alcohol or drugs, and arguments over money) resulted in 1,962 gun deaths (59.9% of the total). "
Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence,A June 1985 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that “the weapons used [in altercations]… were those closest at hand.”
Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence,"An editorial published in the June 1985 American Journal of Public Health noted, “gun-inflicted deaths [often] ensue from impromptu arguments and fights; in the US, two-thirds of the 7,900 deaths in 1981 involving arguments and brawls were caused by guns.” "
Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence,"A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that '[r]ather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance.'"
Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence,"'On the absolute scale, this means that a state like California, which has approximately two mass shootings per year, will have an extra mass shooting for every 10 unit increase in permissiveness over five years,' explain the researchers. 'It will also have three to five more mass shootings per five years for every 10 unit increase in gun ownership,' they add."
Austerity cuts access to essential services,"Years of brutal cuts to public health services, following NHS reform legislation passed in 2012 which moved public health from the NHS to local authorities whose budgets were hit the hardest, had taken their toll."
Austerity cuts access to essential services,"Nationally, local authority budgets were cut by nearly a third from 2010 to 2018, according to the UK National Audit Office and the public health grant fell by £700m in real terms between 2014/15 and 2019/20, as revealed by a Health Foundation report. Across society a decade was defined by the destruction of a safety net built over many years. From the closure of Sure Start centres and libraries to the crumbling estates and rocketing vacancy lists of NHS organisations – few public services were left unscathed."
Austerity cuts access to essential services,"As Sir Michael’s landmark report in February, 10 years on from the Marmot review of 2010, said: ‘From rising child poverty and the closure of children’s centres, to declines in education funding, an increase in precarious work and zero hours contracts, to a housing affordability crisis and a rise in homelessness, to people with insufficient money to lead a healthy life and resorting to food banks in large numbers, to ignored communities with poor conditions and little reason for hope… Austerity will cast a long shadow over the lives of the children born and growing up under its effects.’"
Austerity cuts access to essential services,"There are warning signs that acute budget and service pressures can encourage a retreat to silos or ‘passing the buck’, particularly at the operational level. "
Austerity cuts access to essential services,"The UK’s largest national food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, has documented a 5,146 percent increase in emergency food parcels distributed between 2008 and 2018. In that decade this food bank network went from distributing just under 26,000 parcels a year to handing out more than 1.33 million of them."
Austerity cuts access to essential services,"Our analysis of government data shows that the budget allocated for welfare for children and families has borne the brunt of public expenditure cuts, falling by 44 percent between 2010 and 2018."
Austerity cuts access to essential services,"“Taking care of ‘at risk’ children is a mandatory concern. However, youth centres and outreach services are considered unessential and have been cut to the bone. Yet these are services that help prevent children becoming ‘at risk’ in the first place,” said Gray."
Austerity cuts access to essential services,"“For example, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimate that even if the government locks in a moderate overall spending increase over the next five years, because of commitments to protect certain areas of spending, the remaining ‘unprotected’ areas - including most aspects of social security, prisons, local government and adult education - are facing an average annual cut of 0.4 per cent per year."
Austerity extend recessions,The use of austerity measures during times of economic hardship has caused much controversy about their purpose and usefulness. Many economists have pointed out that the measures have contractionary effects and usually exacerbate ongoing economic recessions.
Austerity extend recessions,"In Argentina, Russia, and Turkey, for example, many high-level government officials resigned when mistimed austerity packages did more harm than good for their economies."
Austerity extend recessions,"For instance, interest rates on Greek debt fell following its first bailout. However, the gains were limited to the government having decreased interest rate expenses. Although the private sector was unable to benefit, the major beneficiaries of lower rates are large corporations. Consumers benefited only marginally from lower rates, but the lack of sustainable economic growth kept borrowing at depressed levels despite the lower rates."
Austerity extend recessions,"“If he wants to reassure the markets, he will have to announce early action in the form of a big fiscal tightening. That could deepen and/or lengthen the recession and ultimately create an even bigger fiscal hole,” said Ruth Gregory, senior U.K. economist at Capital Economics."
Austerity extend recessions,"The financial press and many economists have pointed to austerity policies that cut government expenditures and increased tax rates as an explanation for the slow recovery in several European countries (e.g. Blanchard and Leigh 2013, Krugman 2015). "
Austerity is unfair to the citizens,"In an excoriating 24-page report, which will be presented to the UN human rights council in Geneva next year, the eminent human rights lawyer Philip Alston said that in the UK 'poverty is a political choice'."
Austerity is unfair to the citizens,"Philip Alston, the UN’s rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, ended a two-week fact-finding mission to the UK with a stinging declaration that levels of child poverty were “not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster”, even though the UK is the world’s fifth largest economy,"
Austerity is unfair to the citizens,"Austerity Britain was in breach of four UN human rights agreements relating to women, children, disabled people and economic and social rights. “If you got a group of misogynists in a room and said how can we make this system work for men and not for women they would not have come up with too many ideas that are not already in place,” Philip Alston said."
Austerity is unfair to the citizens,"It is likely to crystallise growing public unease over the impact of nearly a decade of cuts to the welfare state and public services, which studies have shown have had a disproportionate effect on the poor, the disabled and women. "
Austerity is unfair to the citizens,"Margaret Greenwood, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “The government should listen to the people being pushed into poverty by its policies. Universal credit is failing miserably, leaving families in debt, [in] rent arrears and at risk of becoming homeless. Three million children are growing up in poverty despite living in a working household."
Austerity is unfair to the citizens,"Universal credit has punched us in the face. Before much longer people will turn to crime. People will smash the windows to get what they want. This is going to cause riots – Denise Hunter, 57, at the West End food bank in Newcastle-on-Tyne"
Austerity is unfair to the citizens,"I got hungry because I was smelling the other food. I had to take my eyes away from it. The most unfair thing is the government knows families are going through hard times but they decide not to do anything about it – John Adebola-Samuel, 12, whose family couldn’t get school meals in Dumfries, Scotland, because of their immigration status"
Austerity is unfair to the citizens,"I wash in what I call a birdbath – a little hot water in a basin and have a spruce down. To keep warm I wrap up in layers and layers. I never thought I would be 48 and in this position – Sharon Morton, 48, at Newcastle Citizens Advice Bureau"
Austerity is unfair to the citizens,"If people don’t have enough space at home, you need to be outside and you are exposed to the big world and all sorts of people and pick up bad habits. Anyone offering them a way of making money, they will take it. That’s why I think drugs and crime are on the increase – Sahra Roble, 19, from South Acton in London"
Austerity is unfair to the citizens,"I was 18 [and homeless] and the council said I was not a priority. I was struggling with depression and anxiety and juggling work. I was told that if I stop work and have a baby I would be more likely to get housing – Tayah, west London."
Austerity is unfair to the citizens,"IMF-required austerity is significantly associated with rising inequality, by increasing the income share to the top ten percent at the expense of the bottom 80 percent. Unsurprisingly, the impact can also be seen in significantly rising poverty levels in countries facing tighter austerity requirements."
Austerity results in lower growth,"In exchange for bailouts, the EU and European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on an austerity program that sought to bring Greece's finances under control. Greece's deficit has dramatically decreased, but the country's austerity program has been a disaster in terms of healing the economy."
Austerity results in lower growth,"Austerity undermined improving public finances and suppressed tax revenues, with cumulative government borrowing through to 2023-24 now likely to be double (+£450bn) the original plan to get it down to zero in five years."
Austerity results in lower growth,Because the evidence shows that austerity strangled the green shoots of economic recovery that were sprouting when the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition took office.
Austerity results in lower growth,"On average, pay growth halved across OECD countries in the nine post-crisis years compared to the nine pre-crisis years."
Austerity results in lower growth,"The OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. For many countries – including the UK – price rises mean that the standard of living has fallen over the last decade."
Austerity results in lower job creation,"Cutting government spending, many believe, leads to large-scale unemployment. Robust public sector spending, they suggest, reduces unemployment and therefore increases the number of income-tax payers. "
Austerity results in lower job creation,"Recently, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) released their World Employment Social Outlook for 2016. In this document they provide additional details on the global outlook for the near future. Between 2014 and 2016 the unemployment rate in European countries averaged between 10.2 and 9.2%."
Austerity results in lower job creation,"Countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Spain are affected up to the point where basic rights like access to jobs, the right to work, etc. are under threat. Greece and Spain’s unemployment rates for example are respectively 25.6% and 22.9%."
Austerity results in lower job creation,"In 2012, the World of Work Report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO),stated that women have a higher probability of being unemployed or finding themselves in vulnerable employment positions in comparison to men. According to the ILO, they face systemic barriers in nearly all aspects of employment. As a side effect which cannot be underestimated or ignored, the austerity measures further enforce these barriers. These barriers are all in regard to; receiving ample childcare, the level of pay, the access to higher-paying traditionally “male” occupations, job security, pension entitlement, benefits, etc."
Austerity results in lower job creation,"Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels."
Austerity improves the economic measures,"The United States implemented austerity measures during the depression that occurred from 1920 to 1921.  By 1922, the unemployment rate was down to 7.6% and in 1923 it was 3.2%"
Austerity improves the economic measures,"For example, Canada in 1993-96, cut their fiscal deficit but maintained strong economic growth."
Austerity improves the economic measures,"More recently, supporters of austerity argue that the rebound in economic growth in Latvia and Estonia show that countries who pursue fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. (e.g. Latvia showed fast growth of 5.1% in past 12 months at Q1 2012)"
Austerity improves the economic measures,"If budget deficits are not cut, it can lead to higher bond yields (e.g. in case of Greece, Spain and Ireland)."
Austerity improves the economic measures,"After 2009 recession, many European and US economies faced record levels of peace-time deficit. The UK budget deficit was over 10% of GDP, causing a rise in national debt."
Austerity improves the economic measures,"The measures implemented in 2010 achieved a remarkable degree of fiscal consolidation, bringing the Greece government deficit from 15.8% in 2009 to 10.7% in 2010."
Austerity improves the economic measures,"Contrary to this, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina demonstrated the benefits of ‘expansionary austerity:’ fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'."
Austerity is important in the long term,"Cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. Lower debt levels will encourage the private sector to invest. In 2012, the EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: ‘I can say the medicine is beginning to work’ (Economist). The EU point to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Hungary has also improved its fiscal position."
Austerity is important in the long term,"Some economists argue ‘austerity’ is necessary to reduce budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy.  "
Austerity is important in the long term,"If policymakers and the electorate show sufficient resolve, carrying through with austerity will eventually be rewarded by better financing conditions. Austerity pays off in the long run."
Austerity is important in the long term,"On the basis of Arellano (2008) model simulations we find that cutting government consumption may indeed raise the default premium in the short run. This is not because investors are impatient or schizophrenic about austerity. Rather, this is because with output being temporarily reduced due to austerity, financial market participants understand that a government is tempted to default on its debt obligations in order to free scarce resources from debt service for other expenditures."
Austerity is important to increase stability,"Astute monetary policy and falls in international commodity prices are given by a recent World Bank overview, as reasons for this relatively steady growth in the services and industrial sectors, enjoyed by Morocco and reflected in the country’s GDP."
Austerity is important to increase stability,"Morocco was a heavily indebted country in the 1980s. Austerity measures and promarket reforms have been credited with positive outcomes, including economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment. "
Austerity is important to increase stability,"The relative macro economic stability and control of inflation has had a high social cost, including increased inequality (see Observer Summer 2021), leading to massive social protests across Colombia since 2019. "
Austerity is important to increase stability,A reduction in wages and public expenditure negatively impacts domestic demand. But this negative effect is offset by the positive effect on exports. A strong state commitment to macroeconomic stability and improved cost competitiveness improved the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitated an export-led recovery.
Austerity is important to increase stability,"Put simply, a growth in external demand (consumers outside Ireland buying more Irish produced goods and services) compensated for a contraction in the internal demand caused by austerity (Irish consumers, households and government spending less). It’s the German model of adjustment: commit to macroeconomic stability, compress domestic demand and expand exports."
Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts,Countries use austerity measures to avoid a sovereign debt crisis. That's when creditors become concerned that the country will default on its debt. It occurs when the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is greater than 77%.
Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts,"That's the tipping point, according to a study by the World Bank. It found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for an extended period of time, it slows economic growth. Every percentage point of debt above this level costs the country 1.7% in economic growth."
Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts,"The Greek debt crisis led to a crisis in the eurozone. Many European banks had invested in Greek businesses and sovereign debt. Other countries, like Ireland, Portugal, and Italy, had also overspent. They took advantage of low-interest rates as eurozone members. The 2008 financial crisis hit these countries hard. As a result, they needed bailouts to keep from defaulting on their sovereign debt."
Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts,"Almost a decade after the onset of the global financial crisis, national debt in advanced economies remains near its highest level since World War II, averaging 104 percent of GDP. In Japan, the ratio is 240 percent and in Greece almost 185 percent. In Italy and Portugal, debt exceeds 120 percent of GDP. Without measures either to cut spending or increase revenue, the situation will only get worse."
Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts,"The most commonly proposed austerity measures in the IMF loans include wage bill cuts and freezes (31 countries), increases to or the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) (14 countries), and general public expenditure cuts (55 countries)."
Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts,"David Cameron used his speech at the Scottish Conservative conference over the weekend to hit back. He said: 'Our opponents bleat on about austerity but I tell you – if we don’t get a grip of these debts, they will grip us.'"
Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts,The budget deficit was 11% of GDP in 2009-10. It is now about 5.5% and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) of UK predicts a surplus by the end of the decade.
Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts,"The chancellor, George Osborne, certainly plans more austerity, hoping to achieve a budget surplus and a rapidly declining debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the decade (four years later than he originally predicted)."
Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times,"Despite its negative reputation concerning its commitment to reforms and its implementation record, Greece has put forth an immense effort over the last three years and indeed has taken impressive steps toward achieving fiscal sustainability, with occasionally remarkable results. In the three years since the beginning of the crisis, it implemented a fiscal tightening of some 20% of GDP (around €50bn, while it has committed to measures cumulatively totalling €65bn by 2015) and reduced its budget deficit by an impressive nine percentage points, despite having lost a fifth of its GDP since 2009."
Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times,"For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns."
Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times,"Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'"
Affirmative action boosts diversity,"Scott Plous, PhD, Professor of Psychology at Wesleyan University, wrote in his article “Ten Myths About Affirmative Action,” posted on his website: 'Several studies have documented important gains in racial and gender equality as a direct result of affirmative action.'"
Affirmative action boosts diversity,"Ibram X. Kendi, director of the Boston University Center of Antiracist Research, told CBS News, 'If we as a nation are serious about creating equity and justice, we have to institute programs that have been proven to create more equity in our schools, in our colleges, and our workplaces.' He added, 'Affirmative action programs in education have been demonstrated to increase diversity and increase access specifically for underrepresented groups.'"
Affirmative action boosts diversity,"For example, one study found that students of color experience a 23 percentage point decline in likelihood of admission to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban goes into effect."
Affirmative action boosts diversity,"Evidence gathered by the Century Foundation suggests that racially integrated classrooms can reduce students’ racial bias, improve satisfaction and intellectual self-confidence, and enhance leadership skills. These benefits may translate to better economic outcomes and, among other payoffs, prepare students to work in a diverse global economy, increasing the productivity, effectiveness, and creativity of teams."
Affirmative action boosts diversity,"Institutions of higher education have placed a greater priority on integration and campus diversity in recent decades. White women may have been among the greatest beneficiaries of this effort. Between 1967 and 2009, female college enrollment more than doubled—from 19 percent of all students to 44 percent. During this period, the percentage of white women age 25 to 35 with college degrees surged from less than 15 percent to more than 40 percent."
Affirmative action boosts diversity,"When the practice ended in California, the state’s most selective campuses saw minority enrollment drop more than 50%, and earnings fall for Black and Hispanic graduates. University of Michigan still hasn’t fully regained its share of Black students, despite millions of dollars spent over 15 years. And at the University of Oklahoma’s largest campus, the number of Indigenous freshmen fell 11% in one year, despite the state being home to one of the largest Native American populations."
Affirmative action boosts diversity,"Nearly 70 major US companies, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, General Electric Co., and JetBlue Airways Corp. warned in a brief to the court that without affirmative action they’ll lose access to “a pipeline of highly qualified future workers and business leaders” — and will struggle to meet diversity hiring goals they’ve set."
Affirmative action boosts diversity,"'This matters a great deal for access in the persistently White institutions that generally control the pathways to power in our society,' said Ed Wingenbach, president of Hampshire College, a liberal arts college in Amherst, Massachusetts."
Affirmative action boosts diversity,"By the end of his tenure, UC was admitting more minority students than it was in 1997, the year before the ban on affirmative action took effect."
Affirmative action boosts diversity,"Sander's paper on mismatching has been refuted by several law professors, including Ian Ayres and Richard Brooks from Yale who use Sander's data to show that eliminating affirmative action would actually reduce the number of black lawyers by 12.7% [REF]."
Affirmative action boosts diversity,"A prominent advocate of affirmative action, he played a leading role in the twin Supreme Court cases-Grutter v Bollinger and Gratz v Bollinger-that upheld and clarified the importance of diversity as a compelling justification for affirmative action in higher education."
Affirmative action boosts diversity,"In Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, the APALC submitted a brief supporting the University of Texas in preserving the use of affirmative action in admissions, saying Asian students 'benefited from exposure to a diverse student body.'"
Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past,"Barack Obama, JD, 44th President of the United States, provided the following statement on affirmative action to the NAACP “2008 Voter Action Center,”: 'I support affirmative action. When there is strong evidence of prolonged and systemic discrimination by organizations, affirmative action may be the only meaningful remedy available.'"
Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past,"Affirmative action is a mechanism that has allowed historically excluded groups to attend college. Students of color have long faced systemic barriers in the American education system, including exclusion, segregation, underfunding, fewer resources, and lower familial wealth. As a result, students of color are more likely to fare worse on the indicators of success that colleges evaluate for admission, making it harder for people of color to access top-tier public and private colleges. Race-conscious admissions practices, such as affirmative action, attempt to remedy these inequities by encouraging colleges to take a closer look at some of the nontraditional factors that could make a student successful—factors often overlooked in traditional admissions criteria."
Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past,"Affirmative action itself has been defined as 'any measure, beyond simple termination of a discriminatory practice, adopted to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination or to prevent discrimination from recurring in the future.' (U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Statement on Affirmative Action, October 1977.)"
Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past,"These programs have brought or accompanied significant gains for women and minorities.
